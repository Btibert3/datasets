3,"I think these are amazing for anyone over, say, 5'5"". the way these hung on me (at 5'2"") were very unflattering in the front. they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them. that's all i can say without being crass."
5,"Just got this top and i love it! it's color is more saturated in person, which i like. more of a pinky-purple. very sweet and feminine. i still have a bit of a ""mommy tummy"" and the style hides that pretty well. it's very soft and comfortable as well. overall, happy with this top :)"
2,I liked this top okay but i did not think it was worth full price. i thought it was only average.
5,"It's lightweight, soft, & slinky, unike the average t-shirt. the slinkiness makes it skim the body nicely."
3,Loved that this was an 100% boiled wool dress but unfortunately runs very large. i tried the small and extra small - both were really large in the hips. i will maybe try the xxs - was hoping to make this is winter staple.
5,"Absolutely in love with this top. the embroidery and back button detail make for a unique and fun look. light and airy material will be perfect in warmer weather with a cute pair of shorts. i got a size small and it fits perfectly. measurements: 5'4, 135lbs, 32e"
5,"I am curvy/petite. this fits great, is true to size, is super comfortable and lined with cotton. very pretty and well made."
4,"I love the look and design of these pants. i'm 5'1, 110lbs and i ordered a 25p and still had to get them hemmed to even fit like pants. on the model, these look cropped but mine were even too long to be pants when i got them. i love the pant but if you are a petite, be ready to need alterations to the length!!"
5,"I got these in the brown and the red in my usual xspetite, and love both. the length is perfect for my 5'3"" height and they're not skin tight, but fit like a glove (i have a 26"" waist and 34"" hips). the elastic inside the waistband can get flipped fairly easily if i'm not careful, but it's easy to flip it back. i think that's the only thing that might stop me from attempting to wash them in the machine against the instructions, which say to hand wash only. i wish they had been made machine washa"
3,"Oh wow no.
as the previous reviewer said, much lighter than the picture!
rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this 40something. maybe for a younger audience who like the 90s retro vibe?
the fit is true to size, i tried the 27 and it was a nice snug fit around the bum (waist 28/29, hips 36, usually a 27 or 28 in jeans, sometimes even a 29 if they're super skinny)."
5,"Very cute top. i ordered the white & it is thin so you might want to wear a cami with it. will look very cute with jeans, shorts or skirts. love the back! wish it came in more colors - would definitely order it in black."
4,"I love a jumpsuit for its ease of dressing. this is the 3rd i've purchased from retailer.
material is thin and gauzy as described. with a sweater or jacket it will be plenty warm for so cal winters and great the rest of the year.
if you are all tall, the waist might fall a bit short. i am 5'6"" and the waist just barely hits my waistline.
doubt i would have purchased this item full price, but on sale it's a great deal."
5,"I needed a summer party dress for a few casual special occasions this summer and this dress fit the bill perfectly. fits tts (5'8"", 160lb - sz 8) and is really flattering. it is quite open in the front but i was able to keep everything situated w/ the right bra. purchased it on sale and am so pleased!"
5,"I was worried this sweater would be too tight, but it has a very flattering fit. i am a librarian and this sweater makes me feel like a quirky librarian. i love it!"
5,"This is a great dress that looks better in reality than it shows on the website. the style is very flattering, fitting snug at the waist with just the right amount of flare. i am 132 pounds, 34dd and i bought a size 8 and it fit great. the material is soft and flowing and the cut was true to size for me. the first time i wore it a woman walked across the restaurant to tell me how much she loved my dress. this one is a keeper."
4,
5,"This is the cutest romper ever !! very high quality.. 
it has always been a challenge for me to find and love rompers. but this fit beautifully.
i cant wait to wear it this summer."
5,"Good fit, quality, similar to the brand's other jeans."
1,Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack. washed them according to directions and they were ruined. the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled. definitely going to try to return these.
5,"I've been looking for white beach shorts and these are perfect! as another reviewer said, they are in fact see-through -- because they are meant to be a cover up, not ""real"" shorts. the hem detail is very cute and they're super comfortable! my size small fit tts, and the 3"" hem is nice for tall women."
2,"The quality of the garment is high--a nice substantial yarn and a pretty crochet pattern, but the cut was totally off for me. i'm usually an xs/s, and was swimming in the xs. the arms in particular were huge and drapey, and the whole thing just hung on me (for reference, i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs)."
5,
5,"I love this dress for fall. it is slightly sheer, so i would recommend wearing tights or a slip underneath, but it is lightweight enough for fall that i can transition the dress into the season as it gets colder. one note -- i am 5'1"", and was required to size down to an xs in this dress due to length. the xs is perfect for work, as it hits me slightly above my knees."
3,"This dress is not what i expected. the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it. the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry. when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms. i wouldn't of paid full price but for the amount, i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter."
5,Love love this skirt! quality is great and so comfortable. you can even do this skirt with boots and sweater in colder months! so glad i got it!!
3,This dress is tricky. the fabric is very thin and the under slip it comes with runs small. i wear it with my yoga shorts underneath. the fabric is a very thin linen. my husband loves me in this dress so that a huge pro. its very light and cool perfect for the summer time.
5,"The print, length and cut are all flattering. i bought the other tiny dress that was similar and will buy every pattern they make."
5,"I bought this to wear to holiday parties, but it would work for any special occasion. the embroidery is gorgeous and really pops on the black background. the dress itself is a brushed cotton that is thick enough to not to show every bulge. i said it runs tts. i bought the size 2 and normally would wear a 2 or 4 in retailer dresses. the dress is fitted through the torso and flairs at the hips, so you may want to size up or down depending on your body type.. i did not have any issue with the armhole"
4,"Size down as the top looks too big at the shoulders of you get your normal size. i don't find the material  too see through. it's light, flowy and pretty. not your average boring looking top. unique."
5,"I have a short torso and this works well for me. 34c, bought the 0. there's not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest, but not in an uncomfortable way. definitely doesn't hang and have extra fabric like on the model. 

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric.

unlike another reviewer, i found it went really well with navy pants and i wore it to a business meeting under a blazer. wi"
5,"This dress stunning for the hourglass figure. the hips may be a little narrow. i bought the 6p and 4p and the 4p fit best. i read some reviews that said the hips were snug. it's true- a little difficult to sit down haha but the dress is so flattering. shoulders are a little loose, and i have pretty broad shoulders and a full chest. i'm 5'4, 32dd, waist 27 and 130 lbs."
5,"This is a beautiful top, the pattern reminds me very much of mola designs stitched in panama. i love the contrast of the red stitching against the white background. i'm not as crazy about the buttons on the back sides- not sure what that detail adds to the piece. it is a boxy shape, so be aware it's not going to hug the figure. the cotton is soft and medium weight. overall, it's a stand-out!"
4,"I ordered the red and the the fit is great but the red is actually magenta, not red at all. i'm returning and ordering in a different color."
5,"This dress truly is a work of art and i am becoming a little obsessed with byron lars' clothing line. this is my 3rd dress by him and i have been a size 2 in the other dresses. the 2 does fit in this dress but it is a little snug. not sure if a 4 would look as good because it is meant to be form fitting. the panels trick the eye into making you look thinner too. my dimensions 32c,26,33. it fits perfectly in the hips and waist but is tight on top."
5,"Love this top! a new take on traditional flannel. yes it is pricey for flannel, yes it is not thick like a traditional flannel shirt but it is feminine, sexy, comfortable....even my husband liked it on me. i ordered a regular small, wish i would've went for a petite x-small, however they are sold out. regardless i am keeping :-) for reference i am 5'3, 110-115 and the small is definitely roomy."
1,"I ordered these twice just to be sure there wasn't a glitch. the color is so off! the picture shows a dark blue denim, but they are not they are a light blue - with whiskering! retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading."
3,Still can't decide if i want to keep this. it's super comfortable but much thinner than expected and the color seems more navy blue than black.
2,I had hoped this blouse would be white - but it is cream in color. it was also more boxy than i thought it would be. i am usually a 4 or a 6 and went with the 6. a size 4 would be a better fit.
2,"Sctrachy, short, boxy, stiff.
loved the idea of this sweater, but this was not what i was hoping for"
4,"Received this blouse to wear for the holidays and was not disappointed. the design of the shirt is to be relaxed and flowing. i usually wear a medium which is what i ordered. the shirt fit fine but i probably could of managed with a small if i did not want it as relaxed. so if you are between sizes, you might want to size down. if i did order a small, the sleeves might of been a tad short since i have longer arms. the shirt is sheer, so you will need a cami underneath. i wore a black one which w"
5,"I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim and bought it immediately. finding a jumpsuit for my body type is hard (small chest, rounder in the middle and hips like whoa) but i have to say this one is ridiculously flattering. love the quality and feel of the fabric. i've worn it both braless and with a bandeau and have not needed to wear a shirt underneath, but then again it isn't a piece i plan to wear to work. i'm usually a sz 8/10 and got the medium regular which is perfect. i'm 5'5 and the bottom hit"
5,"This dress is absolutely gorgeous! love, love, love! i am 5'2 and the petite sizing was perfect."
5,"This is one of those 'i need one in every color' kind of shirts. need - not simply want. it is very well constructed. the fabric is the perfect weight and is sooooooo comfortable. the raspberry is a little more dusty rose than pictured online, but it works. i've only had the shirt a couple of day. in addition to wanting to wear it every day, the fabric has not pilled. i'm short-waisted, and i have not had any issue with the high-low hem or cropped length."
5,I just got this dress and i love it! it is classic and beautiful. the zipper is tricky right at the band but otherwise no issue there. i cannot wait to wear it.
5,"This blouse is stunning. i have been wanting it for some time. i finally broke down and purchased it. i am 5' 8"" and about 160lbs. i generally wear size l /size 10. i bought this in a large. i need a medium for sure. i could get away with the large, but it's very flowy. i think the med will be more flattering. i am planning to exchange for a smaller size. i would recommend this blouse for sure. if you want it, buy it. it's often times sold out."
5,"I love this top, i dress it up when i need to be more professional and i dress it down with a pair of cutoffs when it's warm. it is delicate, however, so i try not to wash it too frequently. the front is a bit boxy, which the model demonstrates. the model really encompasses the crisp whiteness of the shirt, the flow of it and the length."
5,"Cute and comfy. seems to fit true to size. flattering and roomy on top for my 34ddd shape, but doesn't make me look pregnant or fat overall, which sometimes happens without a waist to define shape. super cute!"
5,Love these basic t's because there is always a unique cut out which makes them more interesting. fit and wash well.
2,"I wanted this skirt to work! it is soft, comfortable, and cute! unfortunately, it runs to short.  i am 5'8"" and would not be able to pull it off at work. i ordered a bigger size and it still didn't work."
5,"I am 5'7"" and 36a cup. i tried on the small and it fits perfectly. i can see how if i was bustier it could be a problem. it looks better in person, dressy enough for the office but comfortable fabric and nicely shaped. i love this with jeans and can't wait to wear it to work!"
2,"I was so curious to see this skirt. it looks just like pic. really gorgeous bold pattern and a faux suede like fabric. my only problem was that i thought there was too much fabric. i love maxi skirts. i am 5&#39;8&quot; and 136 lbs. it was a bit long on me but just had too much fabric. i have slim hips but this made them look larger. skirt is almost ballroom gown like in its fullness. loved it and someone else might love it but for me, it was too much. wish it worked!"
5,This is a really cute shirt for spring. i love the colored striping and you can dress it up or down. have not worn it yet -- waiting for it to get a little warmer.
4,"This dress is cute and the a line style is quite flattering. a few minor issues: fabric is linen not denim as the name states, petite sizing is still a little large and back zipper doesn't zip down far enough to step into so has to be pulled over head (not that big of a deal). for reference i'm 5'4, 120, 32d and i ordered a petite size 4 and it was a bit large and fell bellow my knees. will be returning for a size 2. fingers crossed!"
3,"I tried this on in a store and it was beautiful except the sizing was way off. i'm 5'11"" and usually a 12 or 14. the 12 was skin-tight and the 14 was so loose it was comical - and even on my super long legs, the cuffs dragged on the floor. plus the lacy panels in the cleavage area are totally see-through and my bra was very visible. i was totally bummed. also incidentally, this didn't seem the best quality. there were strings hanging out of the lacy areas, and the waist tie ties way higher than"
3,"This caught my eye and i tried it on the in the store today (the green). i found it to run a little bit large - i expected the small to fit, but the xs fit me better (better fit in armholes and also less billowy). i really like the way it looks, but ulitimately did not purchase it today. i might reconsider on sale. the flaws (in my opinion) are that it is dry clean only, the skirt is not lined (and should be), and it's a bit overpriced for the quality. but on the other hand, it's very cute and f"
2,"This item is huge. i'm normally a medium, sized down to a small, still massive. couldn't go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest. but the sleeves are very wide, as is the waist. way too much fabric. i had high hopes for this one but it just doesn't work. for reference i love billowy and flowy tops, but this was a tent."
3,"This pretty bohemian dress is murdered by the horrible rayon fabric with metallic thread that feels like little needles pricking my skin. i have a pretty high itch tolerance as wool doesn't bother me too much. i'm not sure how most of the reviewers are tolerating this dress, even with the slip, which doesn't cover the arms and makes me want to tear this dress off. i decided to keep and wear as an autumn/winter dress in which i will remove the slip, wear a deep scoop neck long sleeve top undernea"
3,While i love the green color and the soft waffle knit of this top it was so wide i could have fit two of me standing side by side into it!  i mean it was truly laughable!  don't know what the manufacturer was thinking but this one needs to go back to the drawing board.
5,"This tank/blouse is flowy and i love the design. it was immediately comfortable and seemed true to size. i wore it to a family event with a sweater, black leggings and boots. i'm 5'5,"" 36d and usually wear medium in retailer tops and this fit beautifully from the get go, just love it!"
5,"Soft and cozy, not itchy at all, and it has pockets! i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small."
4,Im a busty gal at a 34ddd and this was pretty flattering. it showed off my curves and hid my unfit belly with ease. i usually am a small to medium and i ordered large in both the grey and gold stripe and i love them both. they fit flawlessly. very flattering and i like the high neck line
5,"After reading many positive reviews i ordered. sure glad i did. i love the light, airy fabric. it hangs nicely. i am mostly a 12, sometimes a 14. i ordered both sizes and the 14 was a perfect fit. i am very pleased with this purchase. thought it might be too girly and/or young looking on me, but not so at all. i got the white and i certainly like the red detail at the button holes too."
3,"I love the look and feel of these shorts - typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that they're practically made of nothing, but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric. however, they run very large. being 100 lbs and about 5', i typically buy size 0 or xs, but these looked a bit ridiculous on me, with how big they are. i tried shrinking them in the wash, since they're 100% cotton, and that helped some, along with getting rid of the creases from shipping"
3,"I have to agree with people who are saying this dress runs small in the hips. even a size 0 is typically roomy on me when it comes to dresses at retailer, but a size 4 in this would have been best on my hips. the size 2 was just a smidge too tight looking and loose on the upper half of my body, which made my waist look thicker than it is, i thought. my boyfriend disagreed and thought it looked nice, but i still didn't buy because my life would not give me many opportunities to wear this thing anyw"
4,I love this dress. it is beautiful and the quality is superb.. i too found it tight in the neck area. i had to untie it as other reviewers have mentioned. nice casual dress.. very comfortable and perfect for vacation this summer.
4,"I first ordered this in the patterned denim. the online photo looks washed out in comparison. the blouse has very pretty detail all along the body and cute brass buttons. the pattern unfortunately looks more vivid in person and as result, i did not like. i brought it to the store and tried on white but it was very sheer (all though the pleating in front helps). i ended up exchanging it with plum which is also beautiful - not as much sheen as shown on the photo, but still beautiful."
4,First i ordered a m. i'm normally a 8-10. the m was too small so i returned and ordered a lg. the lg fits great but there is a huge area of distressing on the shoulder that will turn into a hole. i love this jacket but cannot keep it in its condition. hopefully i will make it to the store soon (there are none w/in an hour of me) and look before i buy.
4,"I was so disappointed in this top. the fabric blend was too thick for summer. the cut was wide across the shoulders, and very narrow and short through the waist. add in the odd splashes in the print, and it spelled disaster.

size: i tend to run between small and xs. i ordered xs. i'm 5'5"" tall, 135 lbs, 34d, 35-29-37, narrow across shoulders, with short arms and long torso.

fit: the cut was so wide across my narrow shoulders that it looked baggy and felt odd. however, the sleeves didn't sl"
4,"I saw this shirt in store a while ago, but could not believe the price and was not about to spend my money on it. however, when it went on sale and there was an extra 40%, i decided to get it. i like the top, it's cute and fun. however, it does poof out a little in the midline. this top goes great with jeans or shorts, and it is cute, but definitely not worth full price for this."
5,"I have a couple of pair of hei hei pants from last summer that i love and was so happy to see these. i am curvy (5'8"" size 8) and got these in a 30 and they fit perfectly in the hips and no gap at the waist. i love them so much that i bought a second pair. the only thing that could make them better is if they had a bit of stretch."
5,"These pants are so comfortable and fit exactly as i expected. i love the variety of fun colors (i went with the gold). they are cooler than jeans, but just as versatile. i am 5'10"" and the length on me is the same as the model."
5,"Surprisingly flattering on, especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust, the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but it's there in a super flattering way), the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office, under a jacket, or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not"
4,"I didn't love it enough to buy it, but did think it was cute. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40."
5,"I get so many compliments every time i wear this dress. friends, strangers, younger, older and even the pharmacist at my drugstore wanted to know where i bought the dress. it has a 70's vibe to it, fun and swingy. perfect for fall in florida with sandals or when it gets cooler, i think it will look great with leggings and boots. i purchased the orange and dark gray in a medium petite (i'm 5'4' and 135) and it hit just above my knee. my favorite dress right now!"
5,
4,"First of all, i've noticed that maeve is running big, i'm normally a size medium or 6 and two occasions now i've needed a size small and this is no different. of course i ordered the medium and would need to exchange it if i want it to fit better. it's loose allover. the only reason i'm not exchanging it is that the color washes my olive skin color. other than that it's a beautiful dress, it hist at the same spot on the leg as in the model's pictures. for reference, 5'9"", 36b, 29"", 38""."
5,"I absolutely love this bra-it is the most comfortable, aesthetically pleasing sports bra i have ever owned. i love the straps! they take some patience to get aligned properly once the bra is one, but afterward it looks amazing. the bra itself is soft and the padded inserts actually stay in place without much manipulation so they are aligned properly. when moving, i do not have any areas that rub or get irritated uncomfortably. i absolutely love this bra. it gives me the support i need for a high"
5,"Spotted this beauty in my local store - hanging (grrr) which made it stretch out. note that it's made of linen, cotton, and acrylic, so it's not heavy, it's weighty. anyways, it seemed to run large just due to gravity, so i ended up ordering it so it wasn't all stretched out. it's got a beautiful a-line cut - perfect for us bottom-heavy gals. love the colored thread woven throughout. worth the extra $."
5,"I didn't think anything of this top online (i really don't care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i'm currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m, depending on the style, 5'3"" 120lb 34b. size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason, on me, the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model, the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but, due to the color and p"
5,"I didn't pay much attention to this shirt on the website...when i was in the store yesterday though, i grabbed the green color because it's so pretty! i went back home to see which shirt this was on the website and was surprised. the picture here really doesn't do it justice. it's very soft, has a beautiful and flattering necklace and the flutter sleeves hang nicely rather than puffing out (like snow white...which isn't my goal!). also, because the sleeves drape nicely, you could wear it under s"
5,"This suit is perfect in every way! (the leg opening could be a little bigger for the size) i would be a small if the leg openings were a bit bigger.

please please offer another suit before december 2015 so i can buy for our cruise!!!"
4,"These shorts are comfortable but so stylish. even though, i love many of retailer shorts, these are one of my favorites."
3,The dress is adorable and has a very nice fabric and a slip that goes underneath. it was just too big for me even as a swing dress.
4,"I think it's prettier in person. the color is a little brighter in reality, and the beading on the lower half is in 2 colors (green and gray), which isn't apparent in the photo. although i would consider it true to size, it's a full looking top. i'm 5'8', and both the sleeves and the length are not as long on me as they are on the model. it's a bit sheer, but i personally found it to be fine with a nude bra. cute vintage look."
5,"I ordered this in a petite (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips, and size 4p fits perfectly) and it fits very well everywhere. however, i think if you're bigger than 34b, size up, because this top is very fitted around the bust. the bottom hem falls right below my belly button, the neckline is not too low and not too high. i chose black because i feel that there are a lot of details and can be toned down with a darker color. i think this top must be fitted for a tailored look, or otherwise one may risk t"
1,"Quality was not what you expect from retailer, especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat, it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned."
5,"This dress is extremely comfortable. the dress is slightly loose under the armpits, but the other than that the overall fit is great. can be dressed up or down!"
5,"This top looks exactly as pictured, it is a little more billowy but i liked that about it. i found that it ran true to size and i am 5'8'', 128lbs and ordered a small. i am going to order the white because the cut is super cute."
3,"Cute shirt but no worth full price for sure. runs small in the bust. and i am not busty at all. definitely order up a size. i am returning mine, however, because of size and price."
5,
5,I love this dress! i generally wear size 10 and the medium fits perfect. i'm a curvy lady and this dress fits great. i've received many compliments on it and might even get another pattern because i love it so much!
4,"I purchased this dress in the blue version. its a lovely dress that would be perfect for summer. the dress fit tts on me .. it is a little low in the neck area and it is a little uncomfortable in the torso area. i am on the fence about keeping it. the skirt is flouncy, cute and fun. i hope i can get it to work"
5,"I bought this dress online to wear to work and i did not expect anything too impressive based on the picture of the model. i am really surprised at how beautiful, well-fitting, and soft this dress is. i am in love. it fits snugly, but the fabric is so thick that it is still very office appropriate (i work at a law firm). i ordered the small petite and it comes to the top of my knees."
5,"This dress is very flattering and has wonderful movement, i'm so happy that it went on sale! definitely worth it!"
4,"I absolutely love the fit and look of these jeans. i am 5'4"" and they fit perfectly. but oh my....the smell! it's like burnt chemicals. i don't know if it's just this pair, or a problem with this dye in general. any one find any solution to this? doesnt seem to go away with washing. may have to return these jeans if i can't get rid of the smell. :("
4,"Great fit and quality. i'm 5'3"" and 130 lbs, size 4 fit perfectly. bought both the blue and black. could definitely dress up or down!"
5,"I am a big fan of trench coats and i love that this one is navy. i typically gravitate toward blues because it brings out my eyes and my wardrobe tends to fall in a blue-ish category. i love that the color of this coat will compliment other pieces of clothing in my closet wonderfully.

i especially love the design of the trench with the wider, pleated bottom which allows for fluffier dresses but also creates an illusion that is slimming for anyone's figure. this is a fantastic, unique design for"
5,It's a soft comfy fabric... cute ruffle... may be a little on the bigger side but still super cute! very form fitting but still fits true to size imo the olive color is even more beautiful in person!
4,"Beautifully detailed top that pairs well with dark denim. top is a bit wide, but i think that is the style. a unique and different piece to add to your wardrobe!"
2,"I ordered a small and it is enormous; i usually wear a size 10. it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler. also, it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the 40s. i'm sending it back."
5,I got this shirt in red plaid and love it. super cute without being too trendy. i wore it with shorts and got lots of compliments.
5,Another success! so comfortable and stylish for spring and summer. very lightweight yet not sheer. design is even more appealing in person. a must have for your closet.
4,"Purchased this dress at the sale price, with an additional 20% off sale, not exactly sure what to expect-- the print is so different than my usual style preference. so glad i did! while the dress is way oversized (for reference, i'm 5'4, 132 lbs) ordered size sm but prob should have gone with xs) it's stylish, yet effortless. today is the first day of wear (at my office) and already received many complements."
3,"I like my clothes loose fitting but even for me this ran large, i am 5'7 134b and medium fit in the shoulders but was too big overall"
2,I loved the style so i ordered on line. it runs small and the arm inserts are so low its awkward to wear. i wish the cut was better cause i love the look but not the fit. i am returning this item..
3,I love this blouse but my normal size didn't even come close to fitting me. i think i would have had to go 2 sizes up. too bad cause it is a beautiful top. not good for us busty girls though.
5,"I ordered the ivory in size xl. it is such a cute, comfortable top. all of the details are well-done. the quality of the material is great too. it's a flowy fit. after washing & air-drying, it does shrink a bit. great tee for summer!"
5,"Color of the dress matches color on my monitor. the neckline is sheer. i am 5'4"" ,125 lbs, 32d and ordered a size 6. i thought it fit perfect. this is a great spring/summer dress and can be worn with dress heels or flats for a dressier look. it can also be worm with tennis shoes (white converse are my choice) for a more casual look.

i think this dress could also transition to a fall/winter piece paired with tights and a suit jacket or cardigan. 

also, i love the pockets, though i do see ho"
5,Stunning sweater for cooler weather. i think it runs a little small so returned first one and ordered one size up which fits perfect.
4,"I bought this dress to wear to a pre-wedding event at an out of country beach wedding in late fall, so i bought it a size smaller than normal, but it fits, so i could say it runs a little big. very cute though and i thought even more flattering than i thought it would be from the picture! i'm more top heavy, and it kind of camouflaged that, which is always great!"
4,"I just tried it on and it fits well, with no extra room. it seems like a nice fall piece to have in your wardrobe. the color leans more towards green. now i have to figure out what to put on top when i wear it!
i think it will be cute with boots."
4,"Last minute i needed a family-friendly top for a chilly night, so i tried on a couple of flowy sweaters at retailer and this was the keeper. while i found other styles a bit too boxy or bulky for my short torso, this has a nice a-line shape that gave me a slim profile while still being forgiving, plus the detail up top is feminine and i liked not having fabric piled up around my neck. i am usually a small but wanted this to fit like the model so i sized up to a medium and voila, i am a model. just"
5,"I'm: 34a, 125 lbs, 5'8""
purchased: small

jacket fits well and is not too heavy. didn't feel tight in the arms. great to wear on a cool spring day! i bought the white and grey jacket."
5,"This is a lovely, well-fitting, embroidered, navy tank, i cannot find a flaw in this. i am 5'5, 142 lbs., 34d and the size 6 is a fantastic fit. one of those tops that is so well-cut that it feels as if one is wearing nothing. the lining is impeccably done and is cut perfectly for the blouse. it has a small cut-out in the back at the v. it fits just as the photo shows and is so versatile-it can be worn with everything from jeans to a formal skirt. six stars!"
3,"I'm usually a 6 in dresses and the 6 here fit okay. loose but still flattering a little long for a sundress. i was unhappy with it looking a little frumpy and being so loose under the arms all my bras showed . i took it back to the store and after reading the reviews here decided to try the smaller sizes...well multiple dresses later i ended up buying a size 2 petite!!! and i'm 5'9"". the 2 reg and petite still had the loose gathering look to the top but both fit much better under the arms so tha"
3,"I love the maeve line and was excited to get this dress. unfortunately, the fit was just bad. the top fit fine but the bottom half was too snug and there were unattractive gaps around the waist and the pockets. don't think another size or tailoring would address the issue. for size, i am 5'4"", 130 and ordered the 6."
5,"A sales associate found this for me at my local retailer. i probably would have never thought to try it on. i am 5'1'' and normally a size 8 or a medium. the size small was still too large, so i ordered a size small petite. it fits perfectly, looks adorable on, and is so comfortable. i can't wait for the warm weather to wear it!"
4,"When i first saw this in the store, i loved the idea of this shirtdress with a twist. i tried it on in my usual size 4 but could not get it over my 32d bust. i wrote it off and moved on. back in the store shopping for a party dress, i saw this was now on sale. although not right for the party, i decided to try it in a bigger size. a size 6 was not available but a size 8 was. perfection! if you are willing to size up, you will be rewarded with a comfortable, versatile dress that can be super casu"
4,I tried these on in the store and was unsure about sizing. once they went on sale i bought the xs and have already worn them twice.good transitional grey colored short into fall. need to be ironed or steamed after wearing for a while but comfy and smooth out easily.
5,"So many retailer coats have gotten away from me. sold out before i could purchase. i bought this during the holidays when it went on sale. i did not want this the be the one that got away. so glad i did. the colors are beautiful, the sweater is really a coat. so it justifies the price. what a gorgeous piece to wear with all of my retailer clothes. length of arms was fine on me. i bought a large. i am 5 foot six."
2,"I really wanted to love this dress. i love the colors and the design of the dress. unfortunately, i have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this dress makes you look pregnant. it's so voluminous that it's not flattering at all. also agree that the lining is scratchy."
4,"Cute shirt, nice for layering."
5,"Gorgeous, color, fabric, and cut. i ordered the blue in a 14. i always wear a 14p or large petite in retailer. i purchased a regular 14. it's a full size too small in the ribcage. cannot zip it up.. i'll be exchanging mine for next size up. even though i'm 4'11"", the length is fine. if you're tall, it might be pretty short for you."
5,"I love this shirt! it is so soft and a bit see through, so recommend wearing a camisole underneath. perfect with jeans! the fit is slightly boxy, but works well."
4,"This ia very pretty dress. however, it is a unique design. i like the design of the dress, but i can see where some may not. i can't see a younger person wearing this. it is more for an older woman. the dress is so soft, does wrinkle easily, but just a beautiful pattern and comfortable. i can see some of my friends thinking this is too much like a nightgown, but i really love this dress!"
2,"I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side, so the garment flows nicely, it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial, heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey, not whi"
4,I loved this top... the color is true to screen. the cut is cute. it's a lovely basic top that has just the right twist to it. i loved the fabric. it is see-through but if you wear a nude colored bra under it nothing shows.
5,Purchased these jeans in a 27 and i am usually a 28 in skinny jeans. i got the 26's on but they were snug. these jeans are so comfy and sit higher on the waist. great jeans!
1,"The colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it, however, i too noticed the 'delicateness' of the material. it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray - including next to the kimono's label. so sad."
5,The jeans are soft and comfortable.  they are the perfect staple in my closet.  more colors please!
3,"This is a cute top, but not worth the price in my opinion. i love the colors, pattern and soft material used. however, the fabric is quite thin and just not worth paying $58."
3,"I have been searching high and low for some good quality jeans. sadly i don't think these are it. i love the design and style of these jeans. great length, great cut, great color unfortunately in the 3 weeks that i have had them they are balling and looking like i've had them for 3 years. i'm so disappointed. and will have to continue on my search. apparently they don't make jeans like they used too?"
3,"I am typically a small at retailer, but always order a small and medium to try since i'm tall. the color of the green is really pretty, and i can see wearing it on the weekend with casual sandals, and dressing it up with a cropped jacket for work. the sizing is way off on this dress, though. the small is too short for me (personally). i'm 5'8"" and the waist doesn't sit low enough for a drop-waisted style. so i tried a medium. the medium is not sized correctly at all. i tried it on and it fits 3 si"
5,I bought this top in the stripe and i'm ordering the black now. it's a nice top to transition from summer to fall (even though the temp. doesn't change much in texas...#. it does run a bit large so size down. held up nicely when washed #hand wash cycle).
4,"If you think you can pull this off by all means try it. the fabric is excellent quality--thick yet soft, and the floral print is lovely (unlike a lot of the prints this season). i am not exactly short (5'6"") and not wide (34-26-36), but this made me look like a houseboat. too bad, as it is such an interesting cut. i ordered down since i can sometimes wear an xs, but the bottom was still voluminous."
5,"This dress is beautiful. it is tts, but since it is so flowy, is not form fitting. i am petite (5'4"" 115lbs) and this is a lot of dress for a shorter/smaller person. if it were less flowy, i would keep it. the design, material and overall product is, however, amazing! this dress would be a beautiful addition to any closet."
4,"I am 5'7, 115 lbs, and tried on a 0. the dress (red) looked great and i loved how it had a slimming effect, and i could wear this to work and the length is appropriate. it fit great, but it was a pain to get out of for some reason. i tried to get out of it through the bottom, but it kept getting stuck on my hips. i eventually got it out through the head, but it was such a pain that i just got frustrated. the fabric is okay- i expected a slightly better quality fabric for the price."
4,"This is such a clean and cute printed dress and i knew that i had to try the dress when i first saw it online. after reading other reviews, i sized up. i am normally a 0 or 2 in retailer. i ordered the 2 and it fits nicely and looks great. however, i feel like the 2 buttons at the lowered rib cage area gape slightly. the tie covers it and holds it in place, unless i sit, then it gapes freely. i am a 32 a so not big chested at all, and yet this fit snug in the chest area. i would worry about"
5,Absolutely beautiful. as soon as i saw the color i had to have it. looks great. i am 5 ft 2 in the color is beautiful. excellently made. very comfy. hood is not bulky
4,But if that works for you it is a cute pattern. this is a lighter weight sweater but good for fall.
4,"I'm 5'8, 130 and ordered a small. it fits very nice and it's flattering. my daughter doesn't like it as she thinks it looks like a t-shirt tucked into pants. i get that but it fits nicely and i like the pattern and tapered legs."
5,"This tunic trumped any other i have seen this season. the style, with the delicate open stitchwork around the upper chest gave it quite a feminine appeal. i especially love the weight of the fabric being on the light side. won't have to worry about hot flashes like when wearing a thicker fabric! it's warm without being bulky. and to top it off, it was on sale and i was able to grab two colors. this tunic is also age appropriate and flattering for most anyone. extraordinary to say the least."
5,"I normally wear a 4, and that technically fit if i didn't plan to sit. i went a size up and it was still gorgeous but now i could breathe.  it is incredibly sexy yet sophisticated, my husband is always asking why i need another dress and when he saw me in he fitting room his eyes lit up and he said you definitely need to get this dress. needless to say i'll wear it on our next date.."
5,"I bought the silvery blue tunic. it is very light grey with a hint of blue. it is so shapely - coverage without being boxy or maternity-like. it covers your bum perfectly and looks great with a dark pair of skinny jeans. the color can really take you through autumn, winter and even spring depending on where you live. i love the sleeve length, too."
3,"I wanted to love this dress, especially because it's been given good reviews. i ordered the blue and tried it on. the fit was pretty good and the color is pretty and deep. i did not like the seam that ran around the drop waist. it created a weird allusion that the two pockets in front was actually a continuous pouch around the dress. i also did not like the neckline - there is fabric added on the shoulders that's in a different fabric and makes it look like you're wearing a t-shirt underneath th"
3,I really wanted to love it but it was way too maternity on me. i love flowy but the flow on this dress hit me in all the wrong places. but i must say i have a 34ddd bust and wear a medium regularly. well i sized down and ordered a small and it just didn't work. it just flowed right off my chest to what looked like a dress concealing a baby bump. overall its cute just not for me.
5,"Easy to wear with black or grey. i will wear as a work jacket, not necessarily just an outwear piece"
5,"I have a hard time with jackets fitting because i have chubby arms compared to the rest of me. i like the way this fits and it doesn't pull when i try to cross my arms in front. i feel like it's good quality and hopefully won't flake the way 'vegan' (i.e. fake) leather can. and i think i can throw it over a top with jeans or a dress and it will be cute and versatile. i also like the length that hits right at my hip. i'm 5'2"" and don't like when jackets like this are are too long."
5,"I ordered this winth some trepidation as the dress looked a bit baggy on the model. i don't typically buy this style of dress because many times, they are unflattering on me. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs, in very good shape. the small was perfect for me. a size up would've resulted in a baggier look. the length is perfect, above my knee; not too short, but short enough so i don't look frumpy. the dress drapes beautifully, and i can wear it with tights and boots now, and capri tights and wedge sandals in"
5,"One in every fifteen items of retailer clothing fits. this jacket is one. easy to grab and keep chill away. hood snuggles up as cozy collar when not worn up. model in photo must have orangutan arms, sleeves hit at wrist on this wearer with shortish arms.

boiled wool fabric is light, which is great for layering. lovely transition fall to winter transition piece. statement jacket that will live on next season and beyond.

thank you, rosie neira."
3,"This is a lovely, well-made piece by maeve, a longtime favorite of mine. the material is great weight and won't wrinkle, colors are vibrant, and design of the dress is cute, if a bit on the short side.

however, i, like some of the other reviewers, didn't love this this on me. the waist hit slightly above my natural waist (and i'm very short-waisted) and this particular sweetheart neckline did nothing to flatter my bust (i'm a 34dd for reference). the end result was a bit too dowdy on top with"
5,I had no issues with size or length. i'm 5'9 34c bust and i bought the striped shirt in a 4 and the umbrella print in a 2. the 2 was ever so slightly tight at the second button but i was wearing a heavy cotton cami. i could have worn a 2 in the striped top as well. i am broad shouldered and the shoulder seam in the size 4 dropped a little so there was plenty of room. these shirts are adorable. i usually don't like button downs but this style is very flattering. the material is light and drapes w
3,"Cute design with interesting details. i felt it ran a bit large. i'm 5'8"", 135 lbs, an 8 was too big and baggy. my biggest complaint with this skirt is the color. it's just not flattering."
4,"I ordered the purple and black first. loved both colors, but they ran large and after i tried on the purple i realized the metallic threads in the shoulder area were irritatingly itchy. for reference, i'm currently 165 and 5' 11"" with broader shoulders. returned the larges and just bought the medium purple on sale. waiting for its arrival to see if the threads will bother me after a bit. beautiful, saturated purple color, btw! very true to the image - not cranberry as one reviewer thought."
5,"This dress is made of a very thick material both on the top and bottom, making it very flattering. lots of compliments!"
1,"Do not buy these pants!  the first time i washed these pants i ended up with big faded spots, and i followed the washing instructions.  i bought another pair and the same thing happened.  i'm out a bunch of money!"
4,"I'm 5'4, 125 lbs, & have a 36 c/d bust; the xs fits great.
i wash everything in cold & line dry... this was no exception. when i took it out of the washer i knew immediately :( i've pulled it back into shape & hung it up, but we'll see.
 dry clean if you want to keep it"
2,Does not look like the picture. lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up. i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs.
5,I was hesitant to get this piece but for the price i couldn't resist and i'm so glad i got it !! it is beautiful in person and can be worn so many  different ways.  it really makes you look slim too ! i got the size small and i am 5'4 and 130 lbs and it's a perfect fit !!
3,"The material was a little itchy in my opinion. the fit was pretty big. almost a night shirt. i'm 5' 3"", and i will probably only wear this around the house with tights. i got a small. i purchased the orange color online. stay away if you have an olive skin tone! it's the pinkish it appears to be on be on the website. i'm 130 pounds 34d"
5,"This coat is so stylish and actually reminded my daughter of the ""madeline"" stories. she just got her first paid internship in the city, so i am buying this beautiful red coat for her to celebrate. after all, a girl has to make a good first impression..."
4,"Love everything about this dress except for the elastic waistband. it's a dressier style, and the elastic cheapens the look--definitely needs a ribbon or belt to cover. otherwise the cut and fit is very flattering, the fabric is nice, and the floral pattern is lovely. i found the dress tts (size 4r and i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs)."
5,"This top is beautiful. everything about it is beautiful. it has lovely detail on the back as well as the front. i chose a size 12 which seems to run true. it fit. however, regretfully i had to return the top. i came back here hoping i could find it in ivory or black... but there's only one color. the dusky rose is lovely, but i'm blonde and true pink is fine; this shade not so good, although as someone else here commented, it is a stunning shade of pink, very unusual -- like old dried roses. i l"
5,Flowing top that looks great with skinny slacks... makes a great and comfortable work outfit.
5,"If you're looking for pretty and flowy, this is it! i frequently wear xs in retailer sizing, but in this top i went with a s. 5'4"", 123lbs, 34a. love the top but debating on keeping it because i'm not sure the yellow color looks great on my slightly olive skin....great with legging capris for summer"
5,"Tried this dress on in a s and it fit very nicely.  it's a very unique dress and i loved it, but i just didn't know where i would wear it!"
5,"This dress can be flattering on any figure type - but especially for women who need a little curve. i always wear a 6 in hd, and this fits nice and snug around the middle with a becoming flirty skirt that is lower in the back than front. flat chested women will have to fill it out with a padded bra. it may not be a great cut for a short person, as it has a long line to it and lots of busy-ness. only drawback, which depends on your taste, is the yellow pattern - it's a weird kind of greeny yellow"
5,"First off, let me say that i am 52 and don't often go for print jeans these days:) however, these are just so stinking fun and flattering that i couldn't say no. these look great cuffed for warmer temps, and rolled to full length will be fun to wear with fall sweaters. if you are looking for something fun and flattering, these are the ticket! i bought the grey version and feel that they will work with many pieces that i already have."
5,"Ordered the pink in a small, but it ran big...the xs was perfect for my 5'6' medium frame. it is comfortable and the fabric has an interesting texture. looks great with chinos or jeans. might need to get the other color."
4,"Love this shirt, but beware that it shrinks if you place it in the dryer. the good news is my teen daughter loves it, too, and benefited from my mistake. i usually wear a s or size 6 and bought this in a medium the second time around to allow for dryer."
3,I love a cropped pant but these do not hit the mark. the pant would have been more flattering if they hit just above the ankle instead of the calf. i think they make the leg look stunted. the material was a nice weight and good quality but the bow being attached was a big design flaw. it look cute tied but would have been much nicer if you could remove it when needed.
5,
5,Hello i could not see how this dress could get anything but a 5 star review . the only thing that i thought would be a negative is that it may stag easily. other than that this dress is stunning on and i feel it runs large . i wear a sz 4 and the xs fit just right i'm 5ft 6in tall looks great with a high heel since its really long to the floor which i like as far as the shine on this dress. i love it it makes it worth the price and dresses up a casual dress . and its very comfortable .
3,"This sweater is really cute, great fit and unique style. unfortunately the ivory color was more yellow than i like. not the right shade for my skin tone."
3,"For reference i am 5'5"" and 145lbs with an hourglass figure and bought a 8 petite instead of my usual 6 because i wanted it to be a bit shorter with the a-line design. the skirt fit perfectly, but the waistband is not stretchy like the rest of the skirt. the quality is great but the design and color is not. the skirt is actually much darker of a red than in the picture, more like a dark red wine. it is super a-line which was not flattering on me and the layers are all individual pieces of fabric"
5,"I received this skirt today and am absolutely thrilled! as a short and curvy lady, i feel most comfortable in fuller skirts (but not too poofy), and this one lies perfectly (does not make my hips look wide!). the colors are soft and very feminine, which also suits my style. it may seem like a springtime skirt, but i will start wearing it with tights and a sweater right away."
4,"Bought this dress as good transition piece into our hot fall. don't usually go for the uneven hemline. but got so many compliments, i'm expanding my comfort zone."
1,"Absolutely loved this top but after i washed it the underside color ran at the stitching. it is all white on the outside but at the bottom hem it has a really cool 1"" lining in a mustard color. i did a cold water wash and flat to dry. i noticed around the stitching at the bottom the mustard color has bled through just at the area of the mustard color stitching. 

i am so disappointed b/c i loved this top."
5,"This blouse does run large especially in the length of the sleeves (but the rest of the shirt fit well) pretty pretty blouse. hides bulges, runs a little long. super soft material. a must have for fall!!!"
5,"If you're looking for a sweater that's super soft and comfortable, you've found it! you could wear this almost anywhere except for a dressy occasion, but then, of course, you wouldn't wear it with a dress anyway. i wish it came in other colors because i'd buy several. it's on the thin side but not too thin. the only thing that i should mention is that it's not a black black but more of a faded or brownish black which is really obvious with black leggings or jeans."
2,"I've never had a problem with pilcro jeans. i own several pairs. however, i ordered my regular size 28 (i'm 5'3, 120 pounds) and not only were these jeans thin, they had zero stretch and after 1 hour of wear stretched out horribly. they fit really loose and hung around my knees and legs which is very disappointing for a skinny jean."
4,"I got this skirt earlier this week and wore it for the first time today. i love the color and the shape. everyone else loved it on me. it looked great with a buttondown. but, i will say that it's short. i'm usually a petite in bottoms, and i wore tights so i wouldn't flash anyone when i bent down. i can only imagine how it would be on a taller girl. it also fits at the natural waist instead of the hip. i'm usually a size 6 in bottoms, but i bought the size 4 because it sits higher up."
5,"I wore this dress yesterday for the first time and got several compliments. its unique and super-pretty in person. it hides flaws well and the material is nice. i must have bigger arms than the model because you can barely tell from the picture what the arm slits look like. i don't mind the way they look, but..the way the piece of fabric there grazed on my arms all day kept making me feel like my bra strap had fallen down. speaking of bra straps, the neckline is wide and i felt like i kept havin"
3,I loved the style and shape of the dress . it does run small. i had to return it because some of the black dots pulled and looked like it might be more of a problem as i wore it
5,"The floral pattern on this tank tranforms it to a beautiful piece.  i usually tend to avoid top with full pattern because it tends to look busy, but not with this top.  i'm usually wear s/m with retailer brand depending with the design.  this tank has loose bottom section, so the s is tts for me."
5,"Three tops for the price of one.....i fell in love with this top the moment i saw it online. i tried it on as soon as i received it with jeans and it looked just how i hoped it would. not too short, just right. then i tried it on with the buttons in front and just loved how it looked. this can be worn 3 ways......back buttoned, front buttoned and as an unbuttoned throw on over a tank and shorts. recommend this highly for just about any body type.."
4,"I like the style, but i ordered an extra small (i am5'4' 120#) and it was still too loose fitting on me, had to return, hopefully exchange for xxs"
5,
3,"Love the color, cut, and weight (its like a fleece-weight coat, but longer and more appropriate for an office.)

within two wears one of the buttons popped off.

within three wears, one of the back shoulder seams had split.

this coat is lovely but shoddily made. worth it with a discount and if you know how to hand-sew, because minor repairs will be in your future. it is so beautiful but not worth full price at this build quality."
5,"I was able to try this one on at the store, and it was so loose on me, i assumed it was a large, but no, it was a small! (i usually wear size 6-8 in dress size, s/m in tops) admittedly, it does pull over the head, with no zippers or elastic to give shape. but it feels like water on the skin and has just the right amount of ""show it,"" plus coverage for wearing around the house, i'm keeping it."
3,"More importatn, super soft matieral and comfortbale, hwoever, when i put it on, ilfelt like i was wearing a robe... i do like the detial in the fabric, but jsut dind't feel right as cardigan. maybe purchase if you are looking for a light robe.

true to size, tried on xs, maybe petite would work too."
4,This is beautiful on. it flatters the figure nicely. the material is a rougher cotton which seems oppressive for summer even though thin. it is very low cut but it looks wonderful.
2,"This dress hit my waist in a weird spot and was too short. i would not have felt comfortable bending over. it was a tad too full which wasn't flattering either.
i really wanted to love it bc they design is adorable.
i need to return it!!"
4,Great sweater but it was just a little too short on me so it is going back. it is extremely fuzzy and soft though.
4,Very cute everyday tee. usually run between an xs or small with retailer and was happy i chose the extra small. a great updated on a classic strip tee.
4,"This romper was so cute and with the great reviews i thought i needed to try it...but once trying it on i realized it was an odd fit, there is not enough fabric to make it look as relaxed as it does on the model. also, the sleeves were a bit wider than they look in the picture. would probably work well for someone with a petite figure."
4,"Cute top, wish they had xxs. looks great with jeans and a fun necklace like pix. i got an xs (5'4 and 135 lbs) and it's still a little wider than i would prefer, but i'm not a skinny jeans gal so might look better with those. i decided to keep it since no xxs. wore all day with jeans for a more casual event, then added a skirt and high heels later for a theater show. super comfortable and looks great for all occasions."
3,Very very cute. bought in store yesterday. put it on today to wear and it is huge. i normally buy a large in tshirts. i will return for either a small or medium but will try on in the store. oh well.
5,"This top was a great find! it has a beautiful print on the front and goes perfect with my olive green shorts, capris, and pants! it is slightly sheer but not so much as to need a cami underneath. fits true to size. i love it!"
2,This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn't love it like i hoped to.
5,"I bought this dress when i saw it go on sale, and i am glad i did! love how it fits the length everything about it. it is true to size and it looks very flattering, i will be wearing it for my anniversary date with my husband. highly recommend! i am 130 lbs, 34d, and the size 6 fit perfectly!"
5,I am very happy with this shirt. i don't like skin tight clothes. i bought this top a bit loose but it does not look like i am wearing a sack. it is tunic length on me so i have worn it with jeans and boots. i love the way it flows while i walk. very flattering on. would definitely recommend!
3,I like the idea of this but had to return it. the fitted liner is attached at shoulders and awkward to get into. the shirt is too poofy. didn't flatter short and curvy.
5,"The design of this shirt is stunning. i can't even tell you how many people complimented me on the shirt. the only thing is it does run a bit long. with it being long, it can go nicely with leggings and boots.

material is a bit thin and should be hand-washed or dry cleaned. i do wish there were more sizes in petite."
5,"I love these jeans. i bought my normal size 28 but after just two hours of wearing them, they had stretched out so much that i could take them off without un-buttoning them! (i probably could have gone two sizes smaller but i wanted them to fit loose). my local store was willing to offer me an exchange. kudos to retailer's wonderful customer service and standing by their products! i actually wear mine un-cuffed with boots and it looks super cute."
1,"Looks fitted on, but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap."
3,"It's a perfectly cute simple summer dress, but the only reason i'm even considering keeping it is because it was a gift. the material is fine but for this price, i expect something more exciting than what is, really, just a modified t-shirt dress. at least more exciting colors or a print or something. the top piece is 2 full layers which could get warm in the summer, and the ribbing is tight enough that you have to wear a bra even if you're small-chested (i'm a 32b and super thin and still neede"
5,This is great and very soft inside. i am wearing it around my house all the time. great over workout clothes or jeans and leggings.
4,"I loved the fabric design. the fabric itself is a bit strange to the touch. i'm hoping it will soften with time. and the smell from the fabric is a bit strange. however, i love the fit and cut and pattern. i will gently hand wash it and hope for the best."
5,"This dress does run large, but i'm wearing it loose and flowy. bought it for desert trip music festival, with booties and a hat or headband, very hippie chic. my husband thinks it's adorable! the prints are darling."
4,"Is it just me? i love these pants i bought them in 2 sizes. first my normal size and then down one size because although they fit perfect in the store, with in a hour of wearing them around the house, they had stretched out so much that i could not keep them up. so i purchased the smaller size (same color) and they stretched out just like the first pair. so disappointing. i took them to my seamstress and she took them in 2 inches in the waist and now at least i can wear them all day. not sure if"

5,"I think this sweater is well executed for what it is--a chunky knit trapeze sweater. i agree with another reviewer that i would ignore this product online, but it caught my eye in person. there was only one of the pink sweaters left in store. the interwoven peachy, heathery color is sweet and flattering. since i'm 5'1"", i ordered had the petite version to try. hope it works out 'cuz i'm eager to own something relaxed and cozy that's actually flattering and isn't a sweatshirt."
5,I am wearing these as i type this. they are unbelievably cozy. would wear them as loungewear if it weren't for the fact that they also look so so cute and i want to wear them out. so soft and a really good fit. higher than my other leggings so i don't have to pull them up ever. but also just really fashionable looking. love!!! one of my favorite retailer purchases ever.
5,"This is a dress worth paying full price for, based on the good construction and lacework. i got it for an office event, and although it is low-backed, the high neckline makes up for that! no jewelry necessary with the high collar. i am 5'10 and 135lbs, built like a column, so i got the 6. definitely not for full-figured women, unless you want it long. very cool orange lining and buttons on the back vent."
4,Bought this in green at my local store and fell in love with it! i also tried one in pink and it was a bit sheer which is why i opted for the green color instead. very nice and feminine.
5,"Love this top! got it in the blue and it looks great with jeans, shorts, crops...some say it's a little short and boxy. while the style is cut larger, i wouldn't call it boxy and i definitely didn't find it to run short. a great staple, wish it came in other colors besides white and black/gray."
4,Was so excited to order this beautiful shirt!  and the color sky is gorgeous!  but as another reviewer said--it runs small.  it was also way too short.  so sadly i will be returning this.  i gave it 5 stars because it is beautiful and great quality--it just didn't fit me.
4,"Alright, so i really love this shirt. but i am having it taken in to fit me. i weigh 110 and am 5 foot 3 and pretty petite, and this shirt is too big on me and i got an xs. i didn't wanna get xxs and am glad i didn't because i think it would be too short. i'm going to keep the shirt, but it is too big on me, it puffs out in the front and some in the back when you stand certain ways and i need to have it taken in, or else it isn't as flattering as it should be. the material is awesome and i love"
5,
5,"I love this shirt! great fabric, nice quality, flattering fit. i have gotten this shirt in 4 colors. my only complaint is that the color names do not match the actual color.. not sure who named these. the orange is a lovely burgundy, and the white is actually oatmeal."
3,"For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips)
i ordered the small and i was absolutely swimming in it. perhaps the petite would have been better, but there was just too much fabric everywhere. the sleeves were ridiculous on me, and even cinching the waist with a belt just wouldn't have slimmed the silhouette for me. i have muscular shoulders, and 34d chest, so the top fit as it should, just everything became way too much elsewhere. the fabric was soft and sw"
4,"I love this top, very slimming and cool fabric. only problem it is very delicate and will snag, as a mater of fact mine arrived with a hole in the back. i'm returning for exchange as i love the way the top looks, but know i will have to be super careful not to snag the fabric."
4,"I'm 5'8, 130 and a small fits nice. these are different with the silky fabric, pattern and piping - busy but still classy. it is hard to match with a shirt as you need a shorter top so you don't lose too much of the pant's unique design."
3,This dress is very cute and is made well.  i bought up a size from what i usually where as one reviewer mentioned the dress is small in the bust. this is always a problem for me therefore i ordered a 14. i was surprised that the 14 was sung in the bust. and then understood why the 16 was sold out. i was 30/40 lbs heavier when i wore a 16..never would have thought i'd have to order up that high. i've been running a 10 or 12 depending on the level of my activity. i'm keeping the dress because i kn
4,"This is an adorable top, but it just wasn't my style. i'm 40 and felt silly wearing a big bow, but if you can rock this look i'd recommend it. the top is a thin sweatshirt material, not a knit sweater or a thick sweatshirt fabric. it is a cotton rayon blend. the sweatshirt part is cropped, but the striped shirt details come to a good length. the shirt trim is 100% cotton. the fit was true to size. it is a bit loose, not overly fitted, but true to size. it nips in a bit at the waist and then flar"
4,"I actually like this top, but i am wearing it as a cowl neck rather than off-the-shoulder. i found it at the store, so i didn't even know it was supposed to be that way. i have the ivory color, and it it does have some tan/beige specks in it, but i don't mind this at all, it adds some texture and warmth. i think it is a great neutral top for work. it has a double layer of fabric, so not sheer at all, and this keeps it smooth over my middle without a tank or cami. 

i am an xs in most retailer to"
4,Ordered this cover up in a mp but it was waaay too big so now waiting for the sp to arrive! hope its a hit!
4,Love the style and fit. great buy! my legs aren't as long as the models however so it falls a bit lower on the knees.
4,"I am usually a medium/large and was pleased to fit in the small/medium that i ordered after reading some of the reviews. lovely piece, great to wear over a short sleeve t-shirt, 3/4 of a sleeve shirt or even a long sleeve shirt when weather permits here in florida. very happy i ordered this!!"
5,Worth every single penny. size up - they are very tight!
2,"These are very pretty, but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package, i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however, even though they are machine washable, i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also, the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing, which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants."
4,"The dress looks beautiful online, and fits the model great. when i got mine, the arm holes were incredibly too tight. everything else about the fit was perfect--length, bust/waist-- but i could barely drop my arms down when i tried it on. unfortunately it will be going back."
3,"This top has gorgeous embroidery, very very nice, looks good in both wine and grey. it runs large. i kept it around not sure whether i should keep it. i usually wear xl, i ordered l and it still was loose at the bottom but fitted at the top. i have a big bust, and the embroidery ended at the top of my bust making the entire look unflattering, because the bust juts out in a strange way below the embroidery. the arms also tend to look wider due to the style. i don't like the fit at all."
5,I love these jeans. they are flattering and don't sag after wearing them for a hour or two. they look great with flats or booties.
5,"I am a little retailer obsessed and have a lot of clothing from here....this has to be the best thing i've ever purchased. it is so soft and beautiful. i am 5'11 and 150lbs and got the m/l ...fits perfectly and doesn't swallow me up but it does hide my bottom and the sides come up but not to wear my side stomach is showing. it does sit at an angle on the body but to me that's so perfect, a little different and not a defect. it is not itchy whats so ever. i love this with skinny jeans and brown boo"
4,This sweater is a nice weight and may run a little on the large size. the orange is a nice tone--more on the blue side-- which suits my coloring more than a more yellow-orange. it is bright! i think it will look great over black top and slacks or light color top and jeans. nice weight for fall. a bit on the stretchy side so i hope it won't stretch too much out of shape.
4,I had high hopes for this top. i love the plaid and design but found it too boxy and short. the front was cut too low as well.
3,Bells out to much i had to send it back
2,"Finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed. i am swimming in the xs (5'4"", 110lbs). the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green, the red is much more red than rust colored, etc. and it's a sweater coat! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality. i don't doubt that it will be warm, but can't justify the price. it's going back to the store."
5,"If they still have your size, grab it. fits a bit snug in chest, but material is light and airy. got so many compliments on it. great style"
2,"The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall, it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again, be wary of it being see through."
3,"I am about 5'6"", 135 lbs and usually wear between a small or a medium. i ordered a small, as another reviewer did. right when i took it out of the packaging, i could see that it was going to be much shorter than you can tell from the online photo. i knew the sweater was going to be cropped, but it falls right at the top of my hip bones. when i raise my arms up, my whole midriff shows. did not flatter my athletic build at all. the fit around the shoulders and chest is fine, skimming but not tight"
5,"My new favorite! i wouldn't have thought twice about this dress handling on a rack in store, but after seeing so many cute pics of ladies in this dress, i caved. i needed a petite, so ordered a sp and xsp. the length on both is perfect. i'm 5'0"" and both hit above my knee in front and hit at in back and on sides. i didn't try on a regular in store, but based on the sp/xsp, i'm pretty sure there'd be too much material for a petite frame. the xsp is cut slimmer and if i had a tiny waist, i'd proba"
5,"How has nobody reviewed these pants yet?! love them! they're more like really nice, structured leggings, but thick enough to be substantial pants. they're stretchy, hold their shape, flattering on my big hips and thighs, and have no distracting elements like belt loops or protruding pockets like some of my other pants, which makes it hard to keep a smooth silhouette under a longer shirt. the only bad--and it wasn't even really that bad--is that these are longer than the 27"" advertised. i'm 5'5"","
5,"I found this to be a very feminine and flattering dress. it is prettier in person. i have the ivory and black print. i agree that it takes a bit of effort to get the slip positioned properly. i might wear a different slip, however i was able to get the slip to stay in place. the print and fabric are a nice quality. i typically wear an xxsp or a 0p. i bought this in the 0 regular because i like my dresses a little bit longer. i think it runs just a little bit small."
5,Lovely foxy sweater. i dressed it down for work but would look fantastic with a pretty skirt too!
3,"This dress was very cute the first time i wore it, but after my second wear, the bottom layer didn't remain adjacent to the top layer and i found it to be awkward."
5,"I bought these cords in navy. the color is beautiful and the fit is great. it is a very slimming fit. i am usually between a 27 and 28, i ordered the 28 and they fit perfectly!"
4,"The beautiful bold print drew me to this top and it did not disappoint upon receipt. however, the bottom ruffle belled so far out on each side that it was laughable! the actual fit is nothing like the picture; clearly the model's arms are placed in front of all the extra fabric to hold the ruffle back.
however, the fabric is beautiful, the fit was perfect (size 2, 5'4"", 106 lbs.), the quality is great and i love the print so i decided to take it to my tailor to ""sew away"" the ""wings"" on both si"
5,"Great little shift dress! for me it seemed to run true to size. i'm 5' 4.5"" and curvy. the regular size 10 fit perfect, about 3"" above the knee. a really fun design with the fringe. can't wait to wear once the snow is completely gone."
5,I had been eyeing this top for awhile and decided to get it when it went on sale. it is a very nice top. i'm going to pair it with jeans and boots for our florida fall but could see it working with a nice pair of pants. it is roomy so if you're looking for something more fitted than i would pass on this top.
5,"I ordered both colors in xxs (xs p and xxs p were both sold out at the time sale came on): verdict, fits really nicely, but short. i would have to wear this with higher rise pants or pencil skirt (like the red one is pictures with a polka dot skirt). i decided to keep the red one, because it is a bot more unique, i do have a few navy tops. the xxs fits ""fitted"" (can't think of another way of saying it), so i like it as it will go nicely with looser bottoms. i love the sleeves, the ruffles make t"
4,"I loved this top. loved it. the quality and color ( i got the red) are wonderful. the top fit perfectly through the chest and the a-line design was super flattering through the waist. however, i am long waisted and the top was simply too short on me. even when worn with mid-rise trousers, my belly showed when i leaned to the side or reached my arms above my shoulders. i so hoped it would be perfect with skinny jeans or leggings - as shown on the model - but on a long-waisted frame it is simply t"
4,"Love these pants -- the colors, style, fit. however, this is the second pair of retailer active pants i've ordered that i've discovered had a hole in them. these are not cheap pants, so the poor quality is inexcusable."
5,"I just ordered this item and wore it yesterday. received compliments from my friends. truly a great sweater. feels soft to the touch. i love the cut and how it falls around my hips. sleeves were nice and long. i am a tall lady with long arms. almost 6 ft, weighing about 155. i got the med which was a perfect fit for me. love the off white. almost thinking of getting the peachy pink too."
4,"Really liked the styling on this jumpsuit. it looks great on, the lattice back is unusual. i had been looking for a little black jumpsuit for the longest time and this fits the bill. just wish the fabric wasn't polyester. on the down side the top buttons are really hard to put on and take off. if you take care of your nails, it could do a number on them. the bottom buttons are easier. can only imagine a struggle when trying to take this off in an emergency bathroom break!"
5,"This dress is fun and flattering. love the pieced denim look and the a-line style. unlike other reviewers, i found this dress to be true to size for my pear-shaped figure. the length is long enough to wear anywhere, and i think it would be flattering on a variety of ages and figures."
5,"I came across this in the store and immediately fell in love with it. the online photos just don't do it justice! i bought the white version because the little pops of red in the details and the dobby weave are so sweet and unique. 

a size 0 fit perfectly. the fabric is a bit sheer, so be prepared to wear a cami underneath. very light, airy, and comfortable!"
4,"These jeans are buttery soft and very flattering. unlike many jeans these do not ride down my waist as i wear them. i am a bit concerned about them long term as they list rayon as the primary fabric, which means they have to be washed very carefully. still, i highly recommend."
1,"Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different , the color is beautiful, but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also, they run very big..!"
4,"In the store i was immediately drawn to the blue/white combination, but on the opposite side of the rack hung the spring colored one, which i ultimately tried on. it was obvious that the dress was a bit oversized, so i chose the smaller of my two dress sizes (10) to try on. this was the right choice, but it was still really big. i am not sure that i could have gone down another size (mostly i wear a 12 in dresses that are fitted), due to my bust (36c) and broad back/shoulders. from the front, th"
4,"I tried on xs regular and xxs petite, i would need xs petite (115 lbs, 30dd chest, 5'1.5"").

love the cut, very cute and flattering, the tie back is styling... but this piece is very trendy, and so i decided to pass as i am not sure how often i could wear it to work. will wait to see if it goes on sale. patter is very fun, nice for the beach or casual brunch with the girls. i do still like it."
5,"I got this dress in pxxs in the gray color, i am 5'4"", 100lbs, petite frame, and it fits like a dream. true to size. the fabric is super soft and thick, drapes well, not too tight, and u can wear a regular bra!!!. length is also perfect, no shortening required (which is rare for me - this could be an issue for tall girls but i wouldnt know about that). it looks great with dressy flip flops for any summer occasion, can be casual or dressy depending on accessories. great purchase, 100% recommend."
5,
5,Have only tried on but it is a very cute skirt and i think will be comfortable to wear. i love the texture of the material. i do wish it came in other colors. it is a little heavier material but not too much.
2,"Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though, i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans, i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the prima jeans i ordered (same review there).
so back both pairs went. 
it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material."
4,Gorgeous dress but fits really large. ordered a petite large. going to send it back and try the petite medium. wish it was available at my store to try on and not have to wait for it to be reshipped.
3,"I thought this was such a beautiful cardigan from the online photos. i ordered it in the small size but the fit is strange. the arms and wrist cuffs are so large it cannot be pushed up to stay out of the way for things i would like to do when wearing it (i'm a teacher and my classroom is that kind of environment). i was also confused by the front ""collar"" ribbing and how it was supposed to lay - open, folded over, partly folded over - it just didn't seem to have a particular style to this area."
5,So flattering on my curvy (and busty) body.  so many swing style tops have too much fabric and make you look larger than you actually are.  not the case with this top - the fabric and cut make the bottom half flow beautifully; so flattering imo.  i usually wear a small or medium in meadow rue and went with the small.  the shoulders and arms fit my small bone structure perfectly; the burn out pattern and color are gorgeous.   can?t wait to wear!
5,"I like the edge of this dress and it balances my narrower hips well. i'm usually between 0p and 00p in retailer dresses and xxsp definitely fit better on my 5'1"" frame (armpits and knee-length where it should be)

love that it's machine washable and unusual. super soft and beautiful color even though i normally gravitate to cooler colors.

bring it on everleigh!"
1,
5,"I bought this sweater on sale and love it. it's very sweet, comfortable, and unique. it fits true to size."
4,I on the other hand wore these once and boy did they stretch during the day! i really hope they shrink back up...
5,Got for a mother  day gift.  think  she will like it because she always at the beach and is very happy go lucky new mother.
4,"I love love love the fit in the corduroy, so thought about grabbing these jeans as well. they fit much pretty well, just the color wasn't quite right. i'm really picky about the blueness of my jeans, and these don't quite match the coloring in the photo. still debating whether to keep them. love the cuff styling and straight leg fit!"
1,"The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass, gel deodorant, etc. i tried the cream but it's very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical!"
5,"I'm not sure why this dress has such bad online reviews because i absolutely love it! it fit tts for me, but i have a large bust so will run big if you are smaller on top. i don't like paying full price usually, but the quality and beauty of this dress justified it! if you are into prints and colors, you will definitely be able to pull it off :)"
5,"I am really into this jacket! the fit is nice although it does very slightly large; however, not enough to go down a size for me. all of the different textures are really cool and the details do seem to be pretty slimming, which is always a bonus. i am a bit worried that the wool will pill like crazy though. let's hope i'm wrong and that it lasts!"
5,"Love this. it's heavy/warm, stylish and a great throw on any outfit. oversized style."
2,I ordered these a size up because i'd just had a baby and knew i needed a bigger size. my pre-pre baby size (chubby phase) were size 8/29. these fit like a size 4. way too small. very disappointed!
5,"My mother, who is not a dress person, ordered this dress for a summer wedding in the black hills. we'd spend 20+ hours searching for the perfect dress, and she'd returned three other options (different stores). after admiring this dress for awhile, she decided to try it, and is so happy she did! the color is just a slightly darker shade of purple than what is pictured in most of the images, but that's what she was hoping for. it fits wonderfully, and looks extremely elegant."
5,"I love love love this top. i love it so much i bought it in two different colors so i can wear it more often. i think it's feminine, chic, and classic. i've worn it several times and i each time i've had more than one person comment on it. i normally wear a small but they only had it in an extra small and i actually like how it fits which is why i think it runs a little large. the only place that it is a bit small is the cuffs at the end of the sleeves. i usually just unbutton those anyway so no"
5,"I ordered both the black & the dark grey, the dark grey arrived first! they are very comfortable & flattering! there is a nice thigh slimming effect. i purchased the size small, regular length & they hit me at my ankle (5,5"", 130lbs), i can't wait for the second pair to arrive!"
4,"I would not wear this to bed - it's almost too pretty! i've been wearing this top under sweaters and shells as the weather is moving from winter to spring - i think it transitions the comfort of plaid into warmer weather perfectly! it dips a little low on me in the front (34b/c), so it's probably not for more professional settings. i like to wear it with a lacy bra-type top peeking out underneath."
4,"I ordered my usual 0p, and this skirt seemed a little long for me. the 00p might also have fit if higher on the waist, as it hung a little, so in that sense, if you prefer higher waisted skirts, you can size down (i am 115 lbs, 26.5-27 in waist). the cut is nice and does flare out, but the one i received was folded and you could see the folds... so it didn't do the skirt justice. the top layer is almost off white, while the under skirt is pink, so that is a nice contrast. the appliquã© is pretty"
2,"The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however, the fabric, despite 2% spandex, has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4'), i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear, i think they would cut off the circulation.

please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer."
5,This skirt is so cute. the fix print is really nice. it's a great piece to add to the fall wardrobe.
5,"Great dress, true to size....wore it to dinner one night while in a beach vacation friends, got tons of compliments! you have to be careful when putting it on, as it may snag! otherwise, highly recommended!!"
5,"I saw these in an email and immediately went to the web to look at them. they fit well and have nice slim look. the bottom of the legs seems to fit a little slimmer on me than in the picture, but they aren't too tight."
4,"I ordered this as it was either in stylist pick or top rated, cant' remember which, but i must say, ti was very nice on. a little loose, but the petite sizes are sold out, so i ordered the xs (petite might have been too short...) the cut is feminine, not figure hugging, but still flattering. i can see wearing this in the fall with boots and a cardigan, not just summer with sandals, so i decided to keep it.

 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist."
5,"As soon as my eyes touched these pants i knew my body had to. not only doo they look great, they feel great. the material is very soft with just enough stretch. they've quickly become my favorites. i loved the first pair so much i immediately bought the other color."
5,"Tried this dress on at my local retailer and just fell in love with it. it is a sleek, almost '90's style design that is so comfortable and flattering at the same time. and it has pockets! i will be wearing it all summer with flats or sneakers."
3,"This romper was not what i expected when i originally purchased. it is much more casual looking in person, and as soon as i got it out of the bag, one of the buttons fell off. it did look good on and fit well, but i will be returning because it is too casual for the occasion i bought it for."
5,"I really love cloth & stone, and this top did not disappoint. i am usually a size small in tops but tend to be an xs in halters because the arm holes are usually big on me. i went with my usual xs and it fit perfectly. it has a nice drape to it and is super soft. i will add that when looking at the picture, i didn't notice that there is a muted pink to the plaid design. i originally thought it was just a navy blue and white plaid. however, there is a really light pink to it as well. i actually w"
5,"It's a light material so it flows. the shine is just enough to dress up when i need. i'm a 12 and usually buy xl of any t-shirt looking style, but the large fit perfectly. i am however not large breasted."
4,
1,I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on. the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me. it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier. i'm 5'4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it's tts up top.
3,"I bought this in the grey as shown in the photo as i'm not fond of horizontal stripes and i felt the striping would distract from the floral accent of this tee. the gray is light and as pictured in the photo.

i bought an xl and the fit is tailored, with some loose flow to it. it is not boxy or big on me.

the fabric is a soft, soft, thin cotton knit and very cool for hot, muggy summer days....esp. in the southern us where it can be pretty intense. since i bought the gray, it's not sheer, al"
3,"The dress is too big. i got size 4, after checking the measurements chart (for reference: 5'7"", 125 lb). it is too wide, not as fitted as in the picture. the cut is too deep (might work better for a bustier lady, but looks pathetic on me). 

the pattern is too bright, much brighter that in the picture (i got red pattern). it's not that the photos represent the colors inaccurately, it's just... the colors are much more vibrant in real life.

the material is heavier than i expected."
1,"I ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy. it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear. the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions. it wasn't as elegant as the model pic (is it ever?) and for this price should fit like a glove. went back within seconds. also, it's pretty short, and bulky short isn't flattering on too many people."
4,"I really liked this top the minute i saw it online, long enough and elegant at the same time. i'm 6 ft tall and i like to wear my stuff loose & have my back well covered. i usually get m/l depending on the fabric and style, got this top in l. this top however turned out to be larger than expected, there is plenty of room on the sides, and that bottom part is made of a thinner cotton material. the fabric of the top is not as soft as it may look, but the pullover is still very cute, maybe after fe"
3,"I love the looks of this sweater on the model! after receiving it, it was still very pretty and stylish to look at. my problem is that i am petite, and the sweater seemed to run very large. it wasn't very fitted. i think the detailing in the back would look better fitted. it made me look rather dowdy and/or matronly unlike how it looks on the model. i think that was because it was just too big. i returned it."
5,This has a classic tunic style silhouette with delicate gold threads. it looks even better in person than online.
2,I am 5 '5 and 119 pounds with an athletic cury body type. the dress wore bulky and ran large at size 2.
4,"Yes it is thin but a great summer blouse. the body runs true to size, but the sleeves are tight..i may try to size up so the sleeves can be more comfortable."
4,"I'm 5'10"" and felt that it was just too short. otherwise - love it!"
5,"I've been looking at these online for a while now, and couldn't decide if they'd fit me or not. i have large, muscular thighs and pants always run tight. when i was in the store today i decided to try them on anyway, and boy am i glad i did. the fabric is super soft, as everyone else mentions, and they are nice and loose, but also look like ankle pants. i actually sized down! (who doesn't love it when they get to do that?!) i loved the way they fit so much, i bought two pairs. i love the pastel"
1,"Luckily i bought this on sale... i now see the instructions online say to hand wash, but i bought mine in the store. the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry. i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size."
3,"This is really a lovely jumper and looks quite nice and dressy on. my problem is a short torso, but then again this may be made for short torso loving people! i felt like i was all legs in it. i never asked anyone else's opinion, though, so not sure if its just me and my complex.
if you don't have a short torso,then you might experience the pulling the others were speaking about because the waist might hit you higher than your usual waist.

overall, i am not sure who this was designed for.. but"
5,"This dress fits really cute. i actually think it's cuter in person than on the site. really flattering. the skirt hits a few inches longer on me than it does on the model, so it's appropriate for work and networking functions. i'm 5'3, 110lbs. i got the 0 and it's great!"
4,Love everything about it but had to get a size bigger to be long an off/ to short for a mom. if i was 20 would be fine.
1,"I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews. i could barely get this blouse over my head! after getting it on, the armholes too are very small. the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie. i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck. i tried the small but think a medium wouldn't have been much better. it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves. i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair. 
if you have a tiny head and pencil a"
5,"Love this dress, very flattering fit and the fabric does not feel heavy but is sturdy - i wore it for first dinner out with my husband after losing most of my baby weight and felt great and confident in it."
4,"I tried on the xs in the store, and i don't need a petite in this, but perhaps a xxs. it is on the shorter side, so no great on my muscular thighs (if petite) whereas the regular size hit me just above the knee. the cut is away from the body, a bit ""a-line"", but not fitted. the colors are gorgeous, but i think this is more of a casual dress, like brunch with the girlfriends, for example. love it... it is now in my wish list for alter :-)"
5,"I purchased this blazer in both striped versions for work. it's basically a blazer/sweatshirt hybrid!

while it does run true to size, i can wear a small or medium in retailer; i purchased medium in this. don't size down if your size is ambiguous!"
4,Cute and comfy! i usually wear a small but bought a medium because it appeared to run a little small.
4,"I love the unique design of this dress.  it also has a nice thick material.  the top part runs small.  i'm normally between size 6 and 8.  i bought this dress in size 10 and the top part is still snug, whilst size 12 is too loose.  the bottom part has a nice flowy material with pockets.  since the top part is snug, it will best not to wear a bra plus the thick material will provide a nice support.  the down side of this dress is that the straps are running long.  i have a short torso, so there's"
5,"I just bought these last week and have had a hard time wearing anything else! they are super comfortable, with great pockets. very flattering and wash up great. wish they made more colors..."
5,"So cozy and warm, great for the cold nights!"
4,"I love this designer so i grabbed at this shirt immediately. unlike their other items, this shirt is linen. it's a great cut and very flattering once you iron it. the only problem i found was that as i wore it throughout the day, she shirt became wrinkled and misshapen to the point where it ballooned out around my stomach."
4,"Our store only had one petite dress in my size in stock. i'm 5'4"" and so can sometimes pull of petite sizing. no in this case. it was a tunic on me. however the dress fit beautifully everywhere else and the quality was beautiful so i'll probably order my size in regular to give it a try."
4,"Like other reviewers, i'm glad i sized down. this is a cute tunic that is definitely great quality, lightweight chambray. i love that it has pockets, but they do puff a bit at my hips."
5,"Love this blouse. the owl design is flawless front to back. the material has a silk like feeling. i would say the arms a slightly tighter than i would prefer. if you have larger arms or have any muscle the sleeves may be tight on you. also, i am a 38 c and the chest fit well (in size large), but would not offer much more room for a larger chest. if you want a looser and relaxed fit as the model shows, i would size up. i love the unique design!"
5,This dress was absolutely gorgeous and beautifully made. i ordered a size down as the other reviews stated the dress ran large. however it was massive. i wanted this dress so badly and mourn that i had to take it back to the store.
3,This is a beautiful beaded shirt. the quality seems good. i just didn't like the shoulders. they are pleated and puffy. the picture doesn't really show them very well. also the collar is a little floppy. i was hoping it would have an option to stand up but that is not the case. the beading is well done and looks to be stable. i just thought it ran a little large and the shoulders looked puffy. i returned it.
5,The colors in this skirt are gorgeous. a super pretty emerald/green color with graphic silver and black flowers. this skirt can be dressed up or dressed down. i'm loving the idea of wearing black tights and flat boots with it to make it casual or wearing it with tights and heels for a holiday party. the weight of the skirt isn't heavy so i think with the right colors can wear it in spring too.
5,The embroidery on this dress is beautiful in person. perfect dress for fall.
1,These pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible! i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either. but i thought i'd give it another shot. never again! i'm on my 5th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completely...i mean huge holes in the fabric where it's just disintegrated. even at extra % off the sale price it's not worth it. the full price
2,I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i don't even know if sizing up will mak
5,"I wear size 8 , ordered a medium, fits great. nice quality, like that you can wear open or buttoned at the shoulder."
5,"I love rifle paper, and when i saw this dress online, i knew that i had to have it. this dress is even prettier in person than it is in the picture. it's pretty and delicate, and can easily be dressed up or down. i found this dress to fit true to size. it definitely has that ""baby doll dress"" fit to it, but i love it! this is a dress that i'll feel beautiful in and pull out of my closet over and over again."
4,"I was planning to order it online but someone returned it to my local store and i tried it on.............. my regular size is 6. i have another byron lars dress size 6 that fits me like a glove. this dress fits beautifully from the waist down. the top part is very loose and at least a size too big. very disappointing. i am not sure if it is just me or this particular dress, but it was not flattering. :("
2,"This sweater was just okay. i am happy to pay $100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy, and not the quality i expected for that price. i may have kept it if it were at about half the price, but it just was not worth it. retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less. i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer. looked great in the photos, but unfortunately in person were not quality garments."
5,Perfection. soft. lived in feel and look without holes or rips. and for someone who is 5 ft 2 in. they are just the right length if i don't feel like cuffing the bottom. fit tts.
4,"I love almost everything about this. first, you know, it's cashmere -- soft soft soft without being heavy. i'm a little afraid to wear it it's so nice. i got the gray, which is a beautiful, light, casual shade of gray that looks great with everything. the pockets are fantastic if a bit useless (they hang lower than i can reach with my hands).

the construction is a bit odd at first. it took me some brow-furrowing to figure out how to put it on, and i don't love the way the two front panels hang"
5,"Beautiful dress that is well constructed. the fabric is substantial and feels expensive.i am 5'4"" and weigh 134, 
36 bust 29 waist and ordered the m/l. i usually wear a 6-8 in dresses, so i worried that it would be too big but it fit perfectly. i am very happy with my purchase."
4,"I also agree that this piece ran very small. my normal size did not zip up. i sized up a size, and it pulled across my thighs. i sized up two sizes, and it fit as i had hoped it would. if you get the right size, it is beautiful on. the colors are so fun, and i love the side slit. i bought it to wear to work with a blouse or blazer, and it is definitely a statement piece."
5,I found these jeans on the sale rack at my local retailer. they were the very last pair and in my size. i couldn't believe my luck.  i tried them on and was very impressed with the fit and feel of the jeans. thyre soft yet substantial. they retain thier shape. . love the worn in look to them.  .. .. so adorable.  nice slouchy skinny jean.. i stayed true to size
5,
5,I ordered this top in xl in the navy print. it fits true to size. it's made of two very soft materials. the printed part looks like sailboats to me. it doesn't wrinkle or have a static problem. the solid knit portion is a good quality too. i love the styling details of the ruffled neck and the middle pleat. it's flattering. i like how the details make this a dressy version of a t-shirt while being very comfortable too.
5,"This is a super cute t-shirt!  it runs a little big and not as long as some t-shirts which is good.   it hits mid-hip on me and i'm 5'7"".    i got the gray at my retailer store and liked it so much i ordered the black one too.   warning:  the black one is actually a brownish-black which i didn't like so back it goes."
5,"I love this sweater.  i am 5' 1"" and tried on the petite in the store but ended up going with the regular size as i preferred the length.  the overall fit was the same.  i bought the blue which to me is the colour shown here, more a grey and purplish colour, beautiful for fall and much nicer than a straight blue.  i have worn it to work several times and always get a compliment.  this sweater is nice for all ages, it is soft, comfortable and versatile.  it might just be my go to fall sweater."
5,"I bought this top in the store where i found they had a beautiful mint color not shown here. i think the length is perfect. so many of the tees, etc. are extra long, so it's nice to have a variety to chose from. i'm 5'5"" and this little tee hits right where my legs begin. it is very free flowing and cool. i own several similar tees and tanks from this line and they are great when the weather gets hot."
5,"I ordered the peach/ivory/tan version in size xl and i love everything about this dress. i'm size xl and a pear-shape so dresses can be hit or miss. this one is a favorite. it's so soft. the mix of colors and the sizing of the stripes/pleats is flattering. it's nice being more fitted on top & flowy through the bottom. i love this dress so much! i'm having fun pairing different combos of necklaces, vests, pins, belts & boots with it. i'll get good use out of this through spring. comfortable, pret"
5,"Love this tank. it is so soft and comfortable. the length hits just right on the hip. it hugs the body nicely, not too tight, just loose enough on a hot summer day. i have this in black and white. i wish they would offer more colors."
5,"This dress is really cute and is a lightweight knit that is great for warmer days. the color is a lovely dusty rose that looks just like the picture. since it is a knit material and does tend to stretch out, i did go down one size so that it would be more form fitting. the length on the petite size is perfect for me."
5,"This skirt is so much better in person than in the pictures. fit is true to size, perfect drape, lined & not clingy, just perfect in every way. it's at such a decent price point too that i think it will sell out--grab it now in your size while you can! 

only ""con"" i can think of is that it might be a bit long for petite sizes, but maybe they make it in petite...?"
5,"Beautiful top but runs very small. based on some of the reviews that i read i ordered two sizes up from my usual size and it is still a little tight in the chest and around the ribs. i would like to exchange for the next size up but it is sold out in that size. considering how small this blouse runs it would have been nice if retailer had ordered some extra tops in larger sizes as i am sure that many people will have to size up. regardless, i love the blouse and would definitely recommend it to an"
4,"I love the desi blouse! i got it in white and it's a little more off white than pure white, but it is a great flowy top. the touch of lace across the bust is a nice accent. the only down fall is that the sleeves are a bit puffy, but the rest of the top makes up for that."
5,"I knew i would keep it as soon as i put it on -- comfortable, beautiful fabric, cute gold buttons!  as well, due to the cut, it feels roomy, but has a slender fit around the arms.  the ""denim"" color has beautiful detail, but i don't think i would like the maroon solid.  i wish there was another nonsolid color -- i would buy another one!"
5,I love this jacket and the price was a great bonus. it fit perfectly and is nice cozy and warm. well made and the beige color is great.
5,"The pictures of this dress do not do it justice. i bought it, cut the sleeves off to be even with the waist line and belted (with a slim belt ) and it is perfect! it actually becomes a very sexy dress, it is a true wrap with a deep v and the vent in the back, i mean this dress paid dividends at the end of the night (to be very honest)!

wearing this to south beach, it will be perfect with strappy, high heels."
5,"This is a great every day dress. the buttons in the back make it very figure flattering, and i love the long sleeves. the fabric is light, so i'll definitely be wearing with leggings.

it's a little tight in the shoulders, which is pretty standard for this brand for me."
3,"Ordered this online in the pinkish color. the material is a little thin. as a busty, curvy lady this one just didn't sit right, ran a tad large, and looked boxy. if you have a thinner frame, may be a better look for you. detailing is nice."
4,"I wish there were 100 colors, i'd buy them all. the white is super sheer, but i'll use it as a bottom layer for something."
3,"I wanted to love this. it is so cute and the xxsp, my usual size, fit perfectly. however there was a fatal flaw in the construction. the hem was not sewn properly - very asymmetrical and lopsided. instead of a scoop like shown on the model, it was much longer on one side than the other. i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me, but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong. this is going back. i ordered another one (now it's on backorder), hopefully"
5,"Just got this dress and am very pleased.  fell in love with the bright color in the store and then came home ordered it at a great sale price!!  color is as shown...beautiful lace trim at the bottom.....back longer than front as described and pockets!!  i am 5'2"" and length on a large comes to just below the knees..in front....i may wear leggings under it...dont like the slip as it is far too tight...will wear a tee or turtle under it..  quality heavier fabric. roomy... linen and cotton."
2,"I love this jump suit.. sorta. looks great on but the dye rubs off on your skin. i washed it and its still happening. when you put your hand in your pockets, they come out blue, knees are blue, thighs, etc. i looked dirty by the end of the day. wish i could return it. fit and look great... not great after wear."
5,"This is my kind of clothing item. i love linen, stripes, pockets and a loose look in an over piece. it has the lining to give a good hang to the coat. linen may not be for all but i do like the look of the fabric. i feel this is true to size giving you the loose look and not a slim fit. the sleeve length is just perfect for this look and finishes the overall style. it does not have any neck closure which may bother some. i have never purchased from this maker so took a chance in quality but am p"
4,"I'm tall with long legs, long arms, and a small chest, and the medium fits me almost perfectly. i love the long sleeves (sleeve length is always a challenge for me) and how the coat accommodates my broad shoulders. my only problem is that the belt wraps around my lower ribs and looks odd. if i can get the belt loops lowered 1.5-2 inches, it will be perfect. if i can't, i'll return it because the coat looks much better with the belt tied if it's buttoned up. one small point: the coat arrived incr"
2,I was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer. this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms. it's clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me. i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it. it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure (5'8 and athletic). i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu
5,"Love this shirt so much i bought it in 2 different colors. the reviews said it was so boxy and plain, but i disagree. looks great with jeans or a skirt without looking looking too casual. love that they are not too long also. so many tees are soon long and these are not thank goodness.
definitely runs big"
5,"I hesitated to order this for a long time but am glad i did. i was concerned that it would have trouble staying on the shoulders, and would be unflattering to my large chest (34f). however, it is surprisingly comfortable and secure (has some kind of rubbery grips on the shoulders that keep it in place). very well-designed, and actually supportive to the chest. it offers the sun-protection i am looking for (i am also very pale and tired of getting odd burns on my stomach and chest), and as i head"
5,
1,"Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size."
5,"This top is beautiful on. i did not find it to be sheer in either the black or the ivory, of which i tried both on. i purchased the black as it was more stunning. i am a medium and it fit absolutely perfect. it has a nice pleat in the front, in case you have a teeny bit of tummy. i found it to be very flattering and will wear it as a date top. it will look awesome with skinny jeans or ponte ankle leggings. the body fabric is a lighter cotton. i am 5'4"" and it hits at hip length. it does not have"
5,"This skirt is a rare find. slimming, flowing, and best of all, it finally sits on my waist and not on my hips, while hugging the hips in all the right places for the streamlined and sexy look. the fabric is substantial, yet soft, so no weird sticking out sides. the color is delicious very pale-tea-rose, better in person that the picture here, and is fresh for summer. nice length for office. easy to pair with either fitting or loose top/s and jackets. i also got a distressed denim pilcro west to"
5,
5,"Walked into the retailer store in new york, while on vacation, and saw this on display. had to try it on immediately and loved the look. received several compliments from customers in the store. it's beautifully made, soft on the inside and makes a great statement piece that i will enjoy for years to come!! you will need to size down cause it runs large. i love it............"
3,"I was looking forward to trying this on after seeing it in the catalog. i wear an xs or small in retailer tops and tried this on in an xs. it was huge. reminded me of a maternity top. it was much more flowy on me than it looks on the model. the material was nice, thin but not see through. the macrame detailing seemed well made. i'd recommend this if you're looking for a flowy top but definitely size down."
5,"This coat is truly gorgeous in person. it's an investment coat, one that i will probably wear for years to come because the style is timeless and the color is lovely. i found it to be very high quality. in fact, i would love to see more coats of this caliber from retailer. the other reviews had me hesitant to splurge on it, but i don't plan on wearing it buttoned very often so that will be a non-issue for me. the lining is one of the best parts of the coat! show it off! i think the problem"
5,"This is a gorgeous, well-fitting top! i was hesitant to even try it on because i was sure it would require a strapless bra, which i avoid. nope. worked perfect with my nude bra. i am 32d so need a real bra, but wore an unlined, underwire bra with no show through. great with denim shorts or more polished with dressy pants or dark jeans."
4,"This is a beautiful knit dress, however it runs large, so be wary. for reference i am a 34d, 28 inch waist, and 41 inch hips. i ordered a medium because dresses usually run tight around my bum, and it was very, very big. i'm hoping the small is much more flattering because the quality of the knit is very nice."
4,This top is perfect under a blazer or sweater! the peplum is pretty and the scallops as texture to the tank. love!
4,"I ordered this shirt to wear with a pair of pants that i had to return - which is one reason the top went back as well. it really is cute and i like the exaggerated key hole in the back. i certainly could have found other things to pair with this top, but it came down to the price. i just didn't think it said $118. hopefully its still around when it goes on sale. its very cute. fits true to size."
5,"This is just a fantastic dress! i bought it in my usual m in the blue and it fits like a glove. i love the varying lengths and the adorable sleeves and the substantial knit which feels amazing on the body without revealing any bumps and lumps :) i took the regular length and found it perfect. the front hits about two inches above my knee and the rest hits a bit lower. i'm only 5""1, but i prefer dresses that hit closer to my knee than mini so the regular was perfect for me
definitely a keeper!"
5,"I bought this skirt for an end of summer ""caribbean"" party. the floral detail is even more fun in person. it looks great with a red top or black tank."
5,"The dress is just perfect. it's fits true to size and the colors are as pictured. also, a bonus, it travels well - despite having so many pleats it folds nicely and can be worn right out of the bag. very happy i got it while on sale."
5,"I found this in store last weekend and thought it was it perfect. i got the size small which had plenty of space for me, usually a 4-6 or small (34a-28-26).
it's long, i found it to be just below knee length (5'6"").
if you zoom in, you can see some detail work along the front edges which complements the pretty openwork in back.
it has pockets too btw :)
this will be worn over everything this summer, let's hope the poly/rayon/spandex blend washes ok!"
5,"I really like this shirt, and have gotten plenty of compliments the first time i've worn it."
3,"If you can get over the fact that this skirt feels (and looks awfully similar to) the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid... then, it's surprisingly fun to wear."
5,My sister gave me this top for christmas and it's perfect. i find myself grabbing for it constantly. i'm usually an xsp and the xxs fits me perfectly. i wear it with leggings and jeans.
5,"Such a cute skirt! the fabric is comfortable and light, and the the tie in the front helps conceal some of those ""tummy issues"" a lot of people want to hide. :)"
5,"I love this tunic! perfect for the beach or by the pool! gorgeous design and even better in person! light weight, i am usually a small/medium and originally bought the small but ended up returning for the medium so i had a little more room up top for wearing over my swimsuit."
5,"Just got both today, skirt and top, and i love how soft the material is. and btw, i learned a valuable lesson from past moth sweater purchases, dry clean; even though the ""how to care for"" tag states hand-washing, d.r.y. clean. the last moth sweater i washed was not in the same shape it was when i first purchased, but i never made that mistake again ;) and it was one of my faves!

i bought this particular top in the large as i wanted the ""boyfriend"" oversized look, and i love the way it drapes o"
5,This dress is very well made. the fabric is thick enough for winter weather and is great for work or a nice party. i do not think the arm openings are too large at all.
2,"I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn't my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle, and i love beautiful detail, none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn't work, though. the end result was an unflattering, confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges, plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast, plus the zipper were just too many things to go t"
5,
4,"I was really excited that they decided to make these. i am a big fan of the tanks and wanted a long sleeve (or even short sleeve - hint!) version of them to wear under suits to work in the winter etc. these do the job nicely - bought ivory and black. other reviewer is right however, something strange in the shoulders as they are quite narrow and the fabric tends to bunch a bit and the arm length is a little strange. i am 5'8 and 150 lbs and order a medium in most retailer stuff and i tend to buy a"
4,"I loved this top when i tried it on. i'm usually a small or medium and ordered the medium based on these reviews. the only problem with this for me was that you can see through it in the back. it showed every lump and bump around my bra. reluctantly, i am going to return it. if you don't have any lumps and bumps i think this is a great top. i wish it had worked for me. i debated about trying it on with a camisole to see if that would help, but don't really want to have to wear a camisole in the"
5,"I have been dreaming of the perfect overall that i can live in this spring/summer. these overalls completely fit the bill. i would normally wear a size 24, but i wanted the fit to be more relaxed with a slight slouchy look. i went with a a size 25 and they are exactly what i wanted. i feel like i can move around feely in these. they are extremely comfortable and the denim is pretty lightweight. i highly recommend these!"
5,"These pajama pants are dreamy in all ways! incredibly soft, with a soft and not binding elastic waist. plus, the print is evocative.

i am 5'8"" and a size 2/4. i bought these in the store. the only size left was one pair of xs. sure enough they fit.

the length is perfect. 

i just ordered a pair for my sister."
5,"This sweater is so much cuter than the online picture makes it look! i think the model is wearing it too large. anyway, this runs kind of big, so size down. it's kind of short in the front, but it hits at a nice, flattering spot. love it."
5,This top is great for layering or by itself over skinny jeans or leggings! i'm 5'5 and this is the perfect length! ??????
5,"I am 5'9"" 155#. i bought the charcoal gray in a large and i love it. fabric is super soft. hangs beautifully. no weird spreading across the chest like the previous reviewer. i have long arms and the sleeves are long and hit me mid palm just like the model in the photo. i have worn the sleeves rolled up and down and it works. recommend this for a casual comfy top with interesting design."
5,"Bought both colors - nice quality top, but they do run large. for reference, i'm 5'4"", 115lbs and xs is still kind of big on me. wish they have xxs."
4,"I received this today and totally bummed it's not cold enough where i live to where this yet. this style of sweater is what initially hooked me into retailer. it looks like one you'd have up in your closet for years. good quality, feels nice, and i love the detail on the sleeve. kind of wish they'd put a little detail on the back, maybe a peek a boo detail of a small flower or another ladybug but overall i'm very pleased."
5,Loved this jacket so much i bought both colors! this jacket is simple yet adds so much to an outfit. the lightweight material makes it perfect for the florida seasons. as for the snaps mine work perfectly i usually just keep them undone for my hands. the sizing i think runs a bit large. i usually am a medium but ordered smalls and they fit perfectly even with the perfect amount of breathing room. highly recommend
4,"To be honest, i bought this dress as a ride-along so i would meet a free shipping minimum in order to purchase the dress i really wanted. i wound up keeping this dress and returning the one i originally wanted. it's pretty, flowy, feminine. i even like the uneven-ish hemline, which normally doesn't appeal to me. it runs a bit large--you might want to size down. i got it in the black and tan...even though it's got short sleeves and is sort of summery, it will make a good transition piece to fall"
4,"This skirt didn't fit me right--i'm 5'6"" and the hem hit too low, making for a frumpy rather than classic look. the fabric and color are lovely, however, and on a taller person this could be beautiful. the draping is beautiful and slimming."
4,"This is a cute top but the sleeves are super long.  they swallowed up my entire hand when i put my arms down to the side.  i also found it to run slightly large.  i ordered my usual medium and i had too much room under the armpits.  the sleeves weren't as fitted as the model shot either, which i would of preferred.  i probably could of shortened the sleeves, but didn't think this style top fit me so i sent it back.  this does not require a cami underneath."
4,Loved this blouse but tried on size 8 (my size). waaaaaay too big. tried a 6 - still big - but the 4 was perfect. the only problem was that it did get a bit shorter in length but also ended up a little more fitted which i really liked.
5,"I typically wear a 26 or 27 in jeans, had to size up to a 28 in these. the legs felt fine in the size 27, but the waistband was a bit tight, so i went with the 28s. i am 5'2"" 115lbs. i'll also be hemming or possibly just cutting these off, they are about 4 inches longer on me compared to the model pictured."
3,"I ordered this shirt in the purple stripe and was happy when it arrived and i really liked the color and style.   however, like the other reviewer, when i tried it on, the little circles on the front line up perfectly with your bra straps.  i even tried a different style bra and had the same result.  sadly i returned it yesterday."
1,Large and the material is too bulky. i returned it.
4,I love these jeans and want to keep them but they are so long! im 5'7 and they wrap all the way under my feet so i cant even have them altered because it would cut the flare out. its kind of crazy how long they are.
4,"I am wearing a medium in the photos, my measurements are 38-30-40 for reference."
5,"Easy, fun and flattering. fits tts. i normally wear a m/l or 10/12. i ordered a large and it fits well. the tie at the back lets you wear it as tight or loose as you want it. the length is good for my 5'9 frame."
4,"I tried on the xs in store (would need xxs i think, it is short enough to not need petite). anyway, the neck part was really bunching up on me (between neck and girls), it wasn't flattering. the rest of the tank is really pretty and flattering though, but the bunching was enough for me to leave it behind. the fabric is soft, and the color is nice warm neutral. i love the lace back with the subtle layer of satiny looking fabric. overall goo, perhaps i don't have the right shoulder shape fr this."
4,A sweet tunic with the distinctive lace hemline. the length is great - just right to wear with skinny jeans or over leggings. not too long but long enough for comfort over leggings! more of a boxy fit (just as expected). wore it with my skinny jeans and short boots and got many compliments.
4,
3,It is a very pretty skirt but arrived extremely wrinkled and the waist is very fitted. overall i probably would not have purchased it if i had actually seen it in the store.
3,"This dress has great potential. i happen to have a longer torso so the fit was off. as a previous review stated, it's short waisted and a lot a skirt which i agree, the hem is also funky. i am still deciding if i want to keep it, but if i do, i plan on altering the skirt to be narrower and hemming it a bit shorter too. for reference, i'm 5'3"" and weigh 110 and i purchased a size 0."
4,"I'm torn on how to review this dress. 

i bought it in a lovely slate grey (which doesn't appear to be available now). it drapes cleanly and is extremely comfortable. it has also proven extremely versatile through weight and body changes. i bought a small and am 5'9"", and am typically ~130 lbs with a very long waist. i wore it through early pregnancy and now love it because i can nurse my newborn comfortably and it still nicely fits my ~150 lb frame. 

the problem is that my husband hates th"
3,"Well, this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event, but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either, although the lace is nice."
5,I saw this dress on someone and knew immediately i had to have it.  it is stunning in person.
5,"Great little transitional piece. i bought the blk/blk floral one & it's not your usual top. sort of quirky & one of a kind looking. i think it's crazy comfortable & i just love it! even its a bit chilly outdoors, toss on a scarf round one's neck & head on out. not the kind of top you'd wear with a jacket."
4,"This is a beautiful blouse that runs one to two sizes too small. i usually wear an 8, maybe a 10 on a bad day. i couldn't get into the 8, the 10 was uncomfortably tight, and even the 12 was snug (i haven't worn a size 12 anything since i was pregnant years ago). i think this blouse would look best on a woman without any curves as it adds curves to any woman's body. since i already have curves, i felt like jessica rabbit in this blouse. it was too much for me. again, lovely blouse, but i would no"
4,I probably have 10 pairs of pilcro jeans and pants and most of the jeans are the skinny fit. i wanted something that wasn't a skinny fit so i thought i would try these straight fit jeans thinking they would be skinny but they also wouldn't be loose. just got them today and when i tried them on they were tighter then the skinny jeans i just took off. i guess i agree with the other reviewers that they fit like a glove. so if that's what you're looking for these will be great.
3,"This top is very cute, but i found it runs small in the bust, which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up, if you have a generous bust."
5,It's exactly how it appears in the pictures-awesome shirt
5,Loved this online and even better in person. inner lining is like a cozy sweatshirt!
5,"I ordered this jacket to complement the larkin dress by moulinette soeurs, which i planned to wear to a funeral. the pair together were perfect. the jacket added just the right touch in fashion and practical warmth on a sunny but chilly february morning in alexandria, va. i ordered my usual size and it fit perfectly, if not a tad bit large. but then i'm not very tall so occasionally items have more material than i need. but i never worry about that since it doesn't usually affect the lines of th"
1,"I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived, it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this, but where was quality control?"
5,Super cute and flow. mine had a bit of stitching problem so i am exchanging it for the same thing. fabric feels great. def recommend
4,"These shipped fast!!! the fit is good. these shorts have some stretch to them, which is nice. there is a green/blue color in the fine detail making them versatile with a few different colors of tops. true to size. the length is perfect for my taste. i am 5'7""."
5,"I was pleasantly surprised when i received this top in the mail. i expected the top to be more of a tee shirt but it is very soft and more like a light sweater. i feel the sizing is true-to-size but the design is not meant to be close to the body. for me, the shoulders and length were perfect.

this top is all about the sleeves. matador? perhaps, but it was the sleeves that attracted me to this sweater. i will wear with with a vest, skinny jeans and booties."
5,
5,"This. jumpsuit. is. amazing.

i ordered the small, and it fits perfectly - loose and flowy, with room for boobs (i'm a 32d) and hips. perfect for humid summers when you'd rather your clothing hang a bit away from your body. the fabric is deceptively light for how it hangs (in a very flattering way) when i have it on. 

i would say that if you're shorter than 5'4"", the petite is the way to go. however, i am 5'4"" and the length hit me almost exactly where it is on the model. i lifted the leg a"
3,This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don't have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though!
5,
5,"Size 2p is perfect for me (32a, 25"" waist, and 32"" hip) with a lot of room left for a big dinner. the design is exceptionally creative and attractive, and the fabric is of very high quality."
2,"I fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it!
unfortunately, when i went to put it on, there was a hole running down the seam in the back. i went to store to exchange, wore the shirt, and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt. horrified, i went home, took a look, both holes along the seam! i will be returning this, i really liked this shirt!"
5,Super cute plaid top. i love the colors they are vibrant and go well with my fair complexion. it is a short top and would pair well with high waisted jeans or skirts.
4,"I purchased in store to avoid shipping costs. my local stores don't carry xxs, so they are mailing it to me. i usually wear an xs, but it was roomier than i cared for and made it look a bit sloppy on me. this tee is more distressed looking in person than online, as well. i wish it were more refined because the neckline is very feminine & interesting; i would have liked the ability to dress it up more. also, the solid blue and coral are lighter in color than they appear on my monitor. the blue st"
3,"The skirt in person is not like the picture. baggy and runs large. i wear jean size 25 and the xs is two size too loose. there's no pocket which is surprising on a denim. the slit in front makes the skirt  look even loose , no shape near what's in the picture. and there's no petite sizes. i am going to return it."
5,"I started buying maeve dresses about five years ago and love every last one that i own! this one is no exception. i bought it in black last week (size s) for my birthday treat, and it was so wonderfully light during the week of 99 f heat in the district. it's feminine and delicate in appearance, yet the material is of good quality and super comfortable. it's awesome, just a perfect summer and probably fall dress."
2,"I like flowy tops because i have a bit of a belly and i like to camouflage it but this top was really flowy. the fabric is great and the embroidery is beautiful, i was hoping for this to be a holiday staple this year. it has to go back though, just too large. i don't love it quite enough to order a size down."
4,"This sweater was in-store in a more neutral color palette and was so pretty. when i tried it on i noticed a few things: the versatility and quality are definitely there - this is a nice piece even at full-price. the downside is that it runs very large. i'm typically a 14/16 and a size xl in most retailer items, and even the large was a bit roomy. the other thing was that the sleeves of this sweater are pretty long (and i have long arms). due to the bell cut of the sleeve you couldn't even really c"
5,"This vest is not only stylish and beautiful, it also has pretty specks of blue and rust and other colors. will go with so much. i love the collar, not too big, not too small, just right. frames the face nicely. can wear with dresses, can wear with skirts, can wear with jeans, can wear with cords, the list is endless. this will make any outfit look pulled together. the accompanying belt or sash hits at hip level, i personally like it more at waist level so i remove the belt and wear without it. f"
5,I have a love and hate with fit and fashion. i love super beautiful clothes that are comfortable to wear. normally i am the one everyone keeps asking where did you buy that and i inwardly roll my eyes because my rule of thumb is dress with the most comfortable thing i can. now i'm also a full figured mama. these outfit made me look chic parisian and made my derriere look like it was very attractive. i have a long torso and a long neck and long legs and it hid my flaws. so if you want to look lik
5,"Gorgeous with that retailer uniqueness.

unfortunately this shade of yellow just wasn't right for me.

but it is a beautiful dress"
2,"This is a great top but it is really big. i have a similar top from the same brand and the size small fits as expected. this top is easily 2 inches wider everywhere. i would love to exchange it for an extra small, but am afraid that even that size would be too large. the blue pattern is beautiful and the fabric is light and airy, which is perfect for warm days, but the size issue is out of control!"
3,"I got the red, which was short sleeved. the shirt itself was so cute, but the fit is very boxy. i got a small and it was way too wide. far wider and shorter in the waist than the picture shows. i am sad to return, but it makes me look like a square. (shape that is)"
4,"I'm so glad i saw this pretty dress on sale as my eye overlooked when it was introduced. i have to agree with the previous reviewer that the zipper on this adorable dress is yucky to grab and zip. i also wish there were pockets but it's not a deal breaker. perfect dress for autumn/winter especially with a thin layer to wear underneath as the armholes are cut a bit large, showing my side boob and bra. i had to go two sizes up because 10p was sold out. skirt profile looks a little too wide, so i'l"
3,"This is a very light, flowy dress. the lining is very fitted, but the dress is actually not fitted. it has a nice flow, but hits right at the thigh area before flowing out. plan to wear it to work.the color is very bright and pretty."
5,"Beautiful material- and washable!! i'm vertically challenged and the slits are a tad bit high, even for me- but still tasteful. i would suggest sizing down as i'm normally a medium in retailer but due to the nature of the material i opted to size down and i'm so glad i did!! no arm hole struggles with my particular dress either. overall just a really cute, versatile, cozy and functional option that will certainly get plenty of exposure for many winters to come."
5,"This dress is a beautiful vibrant color and a classic fit and flare fit. it does seem to run a bit large, i am 5'0"" and 120 lbs. and wore a 2 petite. it fit nicely and was flattering but still a little roomy. 

i added a beaded belt to dress it up for my maid of honor duties and despite all the running around, dancing, hugging, buckling the brides shoes and holding my children the lace did not fray and the shape held up beautifully."
5,"I am so in love with this dress. i think it is made of high quality fabric and very well designed. i am 5'6"", about 145lbs, 34d and the 4 fit perfectly! i bought it for my upcoming bridal shower and could not be more excited to wear it!!"
5,These are literally the most comfortable and the softest jeans i have ever owned. i just got them a few weeks ago and i'm already obsessed with them. they have the perfect amount of stretch that makes them flattering and comfortable but they don't stretch out like all my other jeans do. i ordered my usual size 28 and they fit great! can't recommend these enough!
5,I do not have an retailer where i live so i ordered this tunic online. the material is extremely soft & comfortable ( not at all itchy). tts. i fell in love with it immediately and can't believe how many compliments i received all day long when i wore it to work ( with some skinny ankle length pants). can be dressed up or down. this is certainly going to get a lot of use this fall
5,"You can't tell by the photo but the top is actually a slightly shiny material...so it gives it a classy, going out look. in the picture it looks more casual, but i can see myself wearing this on a night out with a skirt, wearing it to work, or whatever. i tried it on and i thought ""wow, i look thin."" it's a little shorter than i normally wear (don't worry, it's not a crop top, but notice where the bottom hem sits on the models hips, probably mid-rise), but it looked amazing on. zippers in the ba"
4,Soft and flowy and perfect for those in-between seasons.
5,Beautiful fall/winter piece! so soft and comfy!! was unsure about it when i saw it online but once i saw it in store and got to try it on and feel it i could not put it down! i felt you could definitely size down!
5,"I've been looking for a dress to wear to wedding this summer, and this is it. the blue color is lovely and the lace overlay is feminine and pretty. i'm small busted (34aa) with an athletic lower body (think, 120-lb marathoner), and the flare of this dress is perfect. i ordered this in a 0 and a 0 petite. the petite size looked little-girl short; the regular size hit just at my knee and was much more sophisticated. the waistband also fell at a more flattering place in the regular dress. i'm on th"
3,These leggings are great in quality and are thick enough to wear as pants; the rise is perfect. the only issue is that they stretch during wear and end up being a size larger.
5,
5,"This shirt feels so nice, it's heavier weight and so soft.. i think it's lyocel... such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and 34c/d and purchased a size 4. found this item to be true to size, if not slightly loose, but i love the flow of it. highly recommend, the green is classic and timeless, very versatile."
5,"Great arm coverage, soft material, flattering fit. wear with favorite worn-in jeans with holes in the knees and also with white jeans and long or short shorts. i really should purchase another color for summer work staple."
5,"Grabbed this top because i loved the color and to my surprise i loved the style too! it is longer on me than the model (and i'm 5'10"") and it looks great with a long pendant necklace and white skinny jeans. i also wear a white tank underneath just in case, otherwise i think i'd be showing some skin. i like that the front and back are two different materials."
5,Love this sweater skirt by tracy reese. i'm a huge fan of tracy reese clothing and this skirt doesn't disappoint. super comfortable. the colors in the skirt are amazing too. many different colors to pull from. i can see myself dressing this up or dressing it down with flat boots and a denim jacket. i felt it fit tts. i usually wear a small in retailer skirts that aren't numeric sizes. got this one in small.
5,This dress is so much better in person than pictures. details on the sleeves and buttons on the front shows quality and makes it an original looking dress. i've wore it yesterday for the first time and received 4 compliments. buy before it sells out!
1,"I'm not sure if i only received part of this dress as a mistake, but i received the chiffon shell, but there was no slip as pictured. it makes it kind of difficult to wear when the entire thing is sheer. i had high hopes, but sadly, this is being returned. the xs is out of stock now, so i can't even reorder. bummer."
3,"I wanted to love this romper, but it just wasted right for me. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and ordered size small. i may have liked it better with more room in the medium, decided to return. i still recommend trying this product, but it wasn't for me and my hips!"
5,"Bought the red/white. normally a size small but they were out so tried a medium. it fit perfectly. and feels amazing. love how it hangs and know i will get lots of compliments on this! jeans, white linen pants, very versatile how this can be warn."
3,"I expected better from this top, it is thin, will snack easy, and you have to wear a cami underneath. for the price, not worth it. definitely returned!"
5,"I bought this dress for a dinner after my daughter's wedding rehearsal. it is perfect. it is dressy enough for the occasion. it also has a casual look to it. i think it is very versatile. i fell in love with the colors, material and the quality. i am more excited about this dress then the dress i am wearing to the wedding. buy it you'll love it."
4,This shirt fits great. normally wear an xs or a small and a small fits in this. comfortable and cute on. i wish i had ordered the other color as well.
5,"Absolutely love everything about this sweater. i was hesitant to buy because it's so oversized and i was worried it would overwhelm my small frame. but the xs fits great, i love the large knit look and the bell sleeves. pairing with dark denim skinny jeans helped balance out the sweaters oversized shape. wore it work and then to a party and received compliments on it all day."
5,"This sweater is a dream come true for me. when i first spotted it during the 40% off sale, i didn't place my order in time to receive one. but then it came back a few weeks later, and i snatched one up! needless to say, the disappointment and wait was well worth it.

the material is incredibly soft, the fit is just about right (i'm a size xs at retailer, without fail, and this was probably the snuggest fit out of all the tops i have).

a few other reviews says that it runs big because of all the e"
5,"Just purchased this in the lilac color in the store in my usual xs size. the cut and shape are very flattering, with the waist sitting lower than my natural waist. in person, the color looks very different than on the website. it is more a lovely neutral taupe to me. one thing is that the snap at the neck is placed about one half inch off in order for the neckline to lay flat. since this jumpsuit is so cute, i decided that this is an easy fix i can do myself."
5,"I love this top. in fact, when i saw in the store, i was hoping that it would go on sale. i wore it and received many compliments. the underlay provide adequate coverage so no additional cami is needed. this top does run large. i normally wear a 2 and i ordered this in a 0 and it fits perfectly. i would not order this if you are not willing to spend the money to dry clean it. it is delicate and i would not encourage washing it at home."
5,"I fell in love with this blouse the minute i saw it in the store. the colors are a little deeper than how they appear in the catalog, but the greens and browns are beautiful and will be great for fall! it fit very true to size, i usually wear 8-10, and the m fit perfect. the gold beading on the sleeves and neck are a nice extra! love this top!!"
1,"This is the tiniest blazer i've ever purchased in a size 10. i usually wear an 8, but sized up based on other reviews and it was still too small. it's very attractive but please size true to size"
5,"I love this blouse!! the shape is very flattering. the fabric is sheer, perfect for those hot summer days. i especially like the way the sleeves fall, just enough flounce. the buttons are a great detail. i didn't bother undoing them, just threw it over my head. looks great dressed up or down."
5,"I'm wearing lots of these long cardigans right now. this one is comfortable but holds up well. the blue color is a lovely wedgewood blue. the little tie detail on the back of the neck is cute, but doesn't get in the way. it's great for casual or casual work wear."
5,"Given that tunics and thigh-length dresses are the hot new thing this season, i kept finding that my black-only-tights collection wasn't going to fly with my cute new tops and boots. so i searched far and wide for different colored tights that didn't look cheap or inauthentic in color, and found these. i bought them in blue, gray, and brown and i have worn them with so many different pieces! they look more ""rustic"" than the average tight, almost like they are leggings, not tights. they are a lit"
4,"Another great dress by retailer. i've worn it with tall boots with heels, riding boots and booties...all look really good. i've also added a cream/beige cardigan and even a fuzzy/furry vest. very versatile. the only few things that i would have liked even more is that design of the dress be actual stitching and not just a flat print and also the material does shrink a tat when you wash it. it's a staple and keeper."
4,"Got several compliments on the dress the first time i wore it, and know it will work well for both the office, church and even a holiday party or two. i'm right on the line between petite & regular sizes, and could have gone w/a petite (probably medium) size instead as the dress is just a touch long with a deeper neckline for my frame. otherwise it fits well and the color is great, even if it's not quite the same as in the photo. overall, i'm satisfied with my purchase!"
5,"Interestingly, the description said this was blue, but as it looks on the picture, it is more grey. that being said, about the zippie: love. my stylist (i brought it in for a try on session at my local store), said, ""you know how i feel about sweats, i won't like it""... joke on her, she turned around and was ok, i shouldn't have looked, love the ruffles at the bottom...it makes this ""sweater"" much more special. it is actually really cute for casual day, jeans t-shirt, kids... or over sweats. any"
4,"I ordered this online expecting more of a heavier sweater. its really more like a t-shirt which is actually fine. its super comfortable and it's really cute. my only complaint is that it is pretty short. i'm 5'7"" and i would love it if it were just an inch or two longer in the torso. other than that it's a great shirt."
5,"I purchased the navy color of this dress. not only did it look good, but felt good as well. since it is for a wedding, i also purchased a white crochet cropped ""sweater"" to wear over as well, making the perfect dress for the mother of the groom. could not have been happier."
2,"I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing, the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also, the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss"
5,These are great for lounging around or even wearing to work as they can be dressed up or down.
5,"This jacket feels like a throw blanket, but has shape and is appropriate to wear both casually or dressed up to make it profession enough to wear to the office. the jacket is bias cut and longer in the back to cover your rear. since it's fleece, the sleeves roll up easily and you can move around in it with ease. it has pockets big enough to carry your phone. i'm 5'7"" 135 with a small chest and i got the jacket in my normal size small and it's loose enough for me to wear layers underneath. if i w"
5,This will be a frequently worn item. print is beautiful and the fit is comfy and classy.
5,I love this top. i'm wearing it today. i bought it to wear under blazers and it works perfectly. i knew it would be slim fitting and while i normally buy med or sometimes small i bought the large and i'm glad i did. it's still form fitting without strangling me the color is very nice as well. nice fabric and well made. a great layering basic.
2,"I wanted to love this dress. the cut, fit and color are adorable. unfortunately the fabric is super thin. due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s. i was on the fence of keeping it, but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it. i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue. i am most likely going to return it; even at 15% off, it is over-priced for the cheap"
5,"This is a beautiful shirt. dressy, imo. it's tts, i would not size down in this shirt. can wear w/ black, white, moss, khaki, jeans, etc... love it."
4,"I bought this dress in the cream color. it was sold out online in most sizes but i stumbled upon it in person and immediately had to have it. i'm usually xs or small, and bought the small. they did not have an xs available so i can't compare, but the small was flattering and comfortable. i'm 5'5"" 120 (34c) and it falls perfectly at my ankles (no dragging) and looks great with simple, neutral sandals. as some reviewers have mentioned it has some weight to it, so it's probably not great for hot da"
5,I tried this dress on on a whim and will definitely be getting it! the fit was perfect as it is not to structured so its really a more relaxed piece even though it doesnt look it... but the way you feel when you wear it is just magical!! i love this dress!!!
5,I ordered this on a whim and am so glad that i did. it's a great color shirt and the embroidery is perfect. i like the length of the shirt.
5,"Rec'd so many compliments on this.  absolutely beautiful, comfortable and versatile.  try it with white crops and cute heels!"
5,
5,"I was a little hesitant when i ordered this dress, but needed something for my husband's company dinner. this dress is perfection! i'm 5'9"", about 160 (i got it in medium), definitely on the curvier side and this dress hugged all my curves in the right places! love the ruching, hides all the imperfections. the color is gorgeous, paired it with a black cardigan and black heeled shooties, got so many compliments! on a plus side, my husband couldn't keep his hands off me all night, kept going on an"
5,"These pants fit the bill! they're soft and very comfortable. easy to wear day and night. these are a little higher on the waist, which i love. purchased two pair! i purchased the regular and they come to my ankles."
4,"I got this number in the turquoise and i hadn't expected the skirt to be ribbed! are they all like that? retailer was out of the petites, so i sized down in a regular instead -- yeah, that didn't work. i definitely needed the petite version and perhaps should have even sized up. the bust was scandelously tight. in the end the dress wasn't flattering on my figure the way this style usually is on me -- the proportions were off somehow. it's just not one of those dresses that curvy petite girls shoul"
2,"I've had a lot of misses from retailer lately. i've loved this dress since i first saw it in the spring/summer releases and gave it a try when it went on sale. when it arrived i literally lol. it's an ill fitting nightgown. the size small was a tent on me and it's so flimsy and sheer it probably shouldn't be worn in public. there's a short sheer slip that comes with it but unfortunately doesn't do much. pass, ladies."
5,This is a wonderful top. it looks great with jeans and shorts. feminine and clever design. many compliments.
5,"When i saw this dress online - it was a must have. i preordered immediately and had my fingers crossed that i'd get it! thankfully it did! this dress has blown me away. it exceeds all expectations!!! i ordered an xl which is a normal size for me and i'm glad i did! the body is very swingy but the top is true to size. the print is magical. whimsical, bold,  bohemian and transitional into every single season. i am 5'8 and the dress hits just above my knees. i feel gorgeous in it. the ""woven cotton"
3,"I thought that it looked like it belonged on a 15 year-old. i can almost see why they styled the model in what looks like ankle socks....ready for cheerleading. for reference it fits true to size, but is very short. i am 5'2"" and tried on a regular small - it was at least 5 inches above my knee."
5,"I saw this vest the week it came in the store. i was hesitant, thinking, ""what do i have to go with this?"" i left the store and had to go back and purchase it. i'm so happy i did! it really does go well simple tops (dressy or casual). it is also perfect for the ""winter white"" trend happening this year!"
5,"I got this shirt in an xxsp, and it has a great slim body. the front ruffle isn't overpowering, although i don't love the ruffles on the sleeves. i think it's just a little too much, but they aren't visible under a sweater or jacket. the length is just right, so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy. the silk is just a touch sheer but not too see-through. it's a good shirt."
5,"So cute! rompers are hard because they are so cute but rarely work for all body types. this one is so super cute. the material is so soft and comfy, feels silky. i got a small and fits perfect. i'm 5'4"" and 117lbs so it runs very true to size when most clothes from retailer run big. i love rompers but only have one other one. this is by far my favorite! i can't wait until it's much warmer and i can wear it all the time."
5,"This is a love at first sight item! bought that home after seeing it on the model. very soft and lovely! especially love the tie back! i wore it with a t shirt underneath. i am 5'4"" and size small. i bought xs and still a bit long. wish they have petite at the store."
5,"Love these pants - they are a perfect color, are of a good weight (i sometimes worry that light-colored pants are going to be see through), and fit wonderfully. they are true to size and are narrow down the leg - perfect for flats, boots, booties, or sandals for summer!"
5,"I just saw this vintage style blouse at my local store and tried it and think this blouse is amazingly beautiful! it's actually very well made and a tad heftier than i imagined from the picture. there's different strips of gorgeous lace all over including that amazing lace at the collar and bib, the arm holes are just perfect in my regular size small (34d-27-35) so it runs tts and i didn't find this overly blousy myself though that's just part of its charm. you'll need an undershirt or something"
5,This coat is so beautiful! like others i wouldn't have even considered it online but i tried it on in the store and absolutely fell in love with. it is the softest material ever and is so flattering on.
4,"The cut, design, and fit were great on this top. however, a few people have written reviews that the top is not see-through. that was not my experience. the top was very sheer and even a nude bra was clearly outlined in it. sadly that was a deal breaker for me and i had to return it. also, on a side note i don't appreciate receiving a garment in the mail from an online order that already had make-up stains on the collar. so just watch out for that."
5,I purchased this sweater online and it's amazing. styling with jeans is nice but to me dark navy pants works the best.
3,"Really liked this dress, but it ran too big for me."
5,"This top is so pretty and feminine. the different floral patterns work very well together and add an interesting flare to this unique blouse. the fit is very comfortable yet still very flattering due to the empire waist and flared sleeves. the fit is true to size, i usually wear a size medium or 10 in retailer tops and the size 10 fit quite nicely. this top is a great addition to any spring wardrobe and should transition nicely into summer as well."
4,"I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down, but i bought it online, so i just decided to live with it. pretty top, though i do think it runs large."
4,I like how this dress is really different and fun with the slit up the front and the short layer revealed underneath. it can be worn in many seasons. i wore it yesterday with sandals but i could also see wearing it with booties and a cardigan. cute dress!
5,This top is so pretty and feminine. i love how the design and quality of this top.
5,"This skirt is gorgeous, sturdy, well constructed. i was afraid the midi length would look frumpy, but it was beautiful. it has a nice lining, flares into a pretty a line, and has a pull tab belt around the waist to cinch it a bit. i am normally a 2-4, and i bought the 4. it was a bit big, but the belt helped with that. i wore it for my bridal shower and got many compliments!"
5,"Bypassed this blouse online, but it's striking colors caught my eye at the store. bought the olive green color and it's gorgeous! the color is great for both spring and fall. i'm normally a petite xs at 5'0 feet and 104 pounds, the regular xs is a great fit for me. not too boxy and the length hits right at my waist. material is lighweight and flowey. don't hesitate to buy, it's a great piece to add some pop of color and goes great with skinny jeans.."
4,"These pants fit great, true to size, heavy enough to withstand winter, and the knees don't stretch out as some pants are prone to experiencing. the one problem is that the zipper is exposed on the inside of the pants so it tends to rub against my upper leg and can be quite uncomfortable. it's nothing wearing a pair of spanx couldn't take care of so i've kept them despite this design flaw."
4,
4,"Great quality, i didn't expect the neck to be so wide but it still looks nice."
5,"I love this dress. be warned that even at 5'4"" it is right on the edge of the shortest length that i can get away with wearing. i probably will not wear it to church but for a special event, dinner, or the theater it will be an eye catching statement piece without being over the top. it has a quiet appeal. both layers of fabric are thin but that helps it to conform to my figure without hugging it. it softly drapes showing an hourglass while being extremely comfortable. i think some reviewers int"
3,"I got this shirt in stores because it went on sale! i was excited to wear it, but it felt a little long on me. i decided that after a regular wash, it would help it. after washing, it shrunk way more than my other retailer clothes! now the arm straps feel really tight and the fabric lost its flowy-ness. it's a classic shirt, but it may not be worth the price for the quality of the fabric. be careful when washing."
4,"Loved this top from the moment i saw it. i was bummed that this top wasn't available in petite sizes, but since it was my birthday i thought i would treat myself. i purchased the xs. after receiving it and trying it on, it was big under the arms and waist area, i kind of expected that since i am always a 00p in most retailer clothes. i had the top altered at a local tailor and now it fits me perfect."
4,I would absolutely recommend this dress if you have the right body type.
5,"I have never been able to find a maxi dress that just fits me. i'm pretty short (5'2"") and the xs petite comes exactly to my ankles. no hemming necessary! the neckline is very flattering and the waist is a semi-empire elastic waistline that makes this dress both elegant and comfortable. the dress is very stretchy but doesn't look like it. it is absolutely one of my ""summer staples"" now - especially for traveling. if i could have this dress in fifty different patterns i would."
5,"I saw this dress in my local retailer store, and am not sure why i did not try it on then, but later at home it began to haunt me. i loved the colored embroidery against the black. my husband and i will be traveling to europe later this fall and i wanted to take a dress with me that wouldn't take up too much room, and be suitable for times when i wanted to dress-up a little. online i saw that it was available in the petite, and with the reviews warning that it ran large i opted for a medium petite"
4,This dress is so cute but it definitely is highly as other reviewers have stated.
5,"I am so happy with this! i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving it as i expected it to be of lesser quality than what i found it to be. it is a medium weight weave, grey sweater with a beautiful design and texture; one of those pieces that you will tire of long before it wears out! it is a great layering piece but not over bulky or structured tops as it is very smooth fitting without a whole lot of give. that is to say it is not loosely woven so it is better over a snug fitting item. the colo"
4,"This dress is so comfortable, and i love the unique faux leather skirt and lace design. it really adds a special touch to the dress. i only gave it four stars because the top half is pretty boring...i wish the neckline wasn't so matronly. i'll definitely need a bib necklace or scarf to dress it up. i'm 5'5"" and 115 and ordered the xs. i wish the dress cut in a little more at the sides to accentuate an hourglass figure, also. my husband loved it."
5,"I agree a few others, it may be a little bit boxy but i don't even care because it's so beautiful! definitely a top i'm going to love long after this floral craze the fashion world is in begins to fade."
5,"The only negative thing i have to say is that the color in person is different than the picture- it is much more of a coral pink than a rosy pink, which is fine just a tad unexpected! i ordered a size 8 and it fits perfectly (32ddd chest). the laser cut outs in the yoke add a very nice feminine, unique touch to an otherwise basic top. i can't wait to wear it!"
5,"Perfect cozy sweater, nice details. exactly what i wanted to upgrade from sweatshirts."
2,"I was really excited about this dress- the style looked like it would be a spring/summer staple in my retailer-heavy wardrobe. i was really surprised when i received it in the mail. the dress is quite thin cotton fabric and feels cheaply made. for the price, i could purchase a much higher quality dress elsewhere that would hold up better. i've been an retailer fan for more than an decade, but this trend of higher prices for lower quality is disappointing and insirpring me to leave a review for the f"
4,"I really liked this top when i tried it on but as i wore it the bottom of the sleeves stretched out terrible where they looked worn out from wearing over and over, and since this happened with the first wearing and i paid $88.00 i sent it back. if it hadn't been for that it's a comfy and cute casual top"
4,"I bought the white with the colorful stripes. i am not disappointed. the sleeves are rolled and tacked. it seems to run a little big in the torso. all in all, a great summer tee."
5,"I wasn't sure how this top would look on me but i just love it! i am 5'3"", 115 lbs and i ordered the petite small. i may even been able to get away with petite xs. i did not find this top too full, long or tentlike at all. i have a bust as well and it looks very flattering on me. i wore it with denim shorts and it will look great with skinny jeans. i would also wear it on the beach as a cover up. very versatile. i love the color and pattern on the top and really love the black lace on the bottom"
4,"I am a small, athletic build and typically wear an xsmall in tops. naturally, in something with a more straight fit and blousy shape, an xsmall would be appropriate. i ordered it and was super bummed. the lace detail made the collar lay funny and the shoulders were too tight. i liked the sheer fabric though and the lace details and decided to order a size up. i am so glad i did because everything laid like it was supposed to. this top is beautiful with a sexy, but refined look. i plan to dress i"
5,"Beautiful jacket for a light day. fits a little large., so if you want it to fit a little more tailored look, order down a size."
4,"Beautiful dress but runs very large. it is made of a material that does not breath so if you tend to run hot, skip this dress. great style and looks good on almost any body type. colors are very attractive and is dressy enough for special occasions,"
4,"I was debating getting the petite vs. regular sizing. i ended up going with the regular sizing for the addition couple of inches in length. it is very comfortable and not at all a sweatshirt but more of a heavyweight, wider long sleeve."
3,"The fabric is so beautiful that i am tempted to buy in a large size and have re-made. the waist is tiny. the hips are wide. when it goes to half price, i may be tempted to take it to my favorite alterations lady. the fabric is that exceptionally beautiful."
3,"I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp, that's out the window. this design is poor. for one, this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so, without a jacket, i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4."
3,
5,"I wore this dress for an after party the day of my wedding day in new orleans. going to a music lounge!! seriously, i kept getting compliments!!! it's fits beautiful and i just love the different type of patterns!"
5,"If i could live in pilco jeans i would. maybe that's my goal for 2016. they are so comfortable and flattering! i sized down as others and i'm really happy with the fit. my other pilcos are a skin tight 30, but these are a comfortable 29."
5,
5,Beautifully cut and styled!its versatile and can be paired with trousers or a skirt
5,"I love how comfortable this dress is! i ordered an xs and it fit perfectly (i'm 5' 4"" and it falls to just above my knee). it holds its shape and is very flattering. pair it with a cute denim jacket and ankle boots for fall, or a light scarf and ballet flats for spring!"
5,"I am very glad i purchased these shorts on sale. bought the coral color in a large. 5'7"" 140lbs with a generous underside and long legs, i usually wear a m or a l in yoga pants. the l here fits really nicely--not too tight and enough length in the inseam so that i don't feel silly practicing outdoors in the park. the rise is also perfect."
5,"Love these pants i bought them in two colors! flattering fitting!! im 5'4 120lbs 36"" hip. i bought these in size 25. sometimes i don't like petit sizing but these petite at 30"" long inseam still gave me enough length to wear with heals. there is the usual good and bad with linen - after you wear them once you need to iron because they look too wrinkled and worn. the linen is light and washed - unfortunately i don't think these pants will hold up for more than a two years. i'll love them while i"
5,"These fit quite well, and it's rare that i find shorts that fit well without being too tight. great for spring or summer. fits tts."
4,"These days i am more like a 6 after gaining some weight. when i was in my local retailer the other day i happened upon this dress only in a small/petite. i tried it on and it actually fit me very well. i am 5 foot 6 so i thought the petite might be too short or wouldn't work, but surprisingly it fit my body type. i think i'll like wearing it best with a pair of wedges or heels. like most other reviews i'm inclined to agree that the regular size has too much fabric going on and probably is s"
5,
5,"I definitely recommend this shirt. it's lights and airy, something you can wear everyday."
4,"I tried this product in store in red and fell in love with the fit, it fits in the most beautiful flattering way, red looked gorgeous - rich glossy fabric, this could easily be one of those effortless summer transition pieces that can go from a day dress into incredible sexy night outfit. the fabric was very lush and had this rich gloss to it, i have never seen a fabric like that, it almost looked coated. red being such a statement piece was a bit too much for me, so i decided to order the produ"
5,"I am not a fan of unlined bras, but this one was so pretty i had to try it. the lace doesn't look cheap, but overall i wouldn't have wanted to pay full price. it fits well and the support offers a nice shape (no cone!). i might go back for the other color."
5,
5,"I've been on the lookout for a great quality basic black and white stripe shirt. it's easy to find the super cheap ones that last you maybe four wears. this one is great quality, extremely soft, and comfortable. i'm usually a small in tops, but got this in a medium so that it would fit like the model, slightly loose, i didn't want it body hugging. so, if you're looking for that fit, go up a size, it doesn't stretch out much."
5,"These are the best leggings i've ever worn. because they are structured and substantial, they are less casual than ordinary leggings. i bought them for a trip to paris, and i wore them many times. they're sleek, stylish, comfortable, and they go with everything!"
4,"I was walking by my local retailer and saw this in the window and loved the colors. it's a great combination and looks good with white jeans, and regular denim. i like the cuffs on the sleeves and the textured material. it is a kimono - so in essence it is not form fitting. it's meant to flow over whatever else you have on. i purchased the xs/s and i am a normal size 2 and it looks cute. i got lots of compliments when i wore it! there are slits on either side at the bottom hem as well which allow"
5,"Comfortable, cool-perfect summer tank. ordered  one for my daughter(small), had to get myself one too(medium)-both tts. great for errand runs, around house, lounging, sleeping. seems better made than more expensive tops ordered as of late. good job retailer"
5,
5,What a great purchase (especially on sale!) as this tank can't get more comfy. the material is soft and great to wear during those warm weather months. love it!
4,"When i saw this dress online, i immediately passed on it. but i was drawn to it's faint shimmer and soft feel in the store and decided to try it on. i am usually xs - s in dresses and tried the xs (5'4, 34b, 27 waist). it fit beautifully. it comes about a couple of inches above my knee and makes me look slim from the side - which isn't typical of shift dresses. i plan on wearing it with flats now and tights and booties when the weather gets cooler. would be a great holiday or new years eve dress"
5,"I absolutely love this cardigan! it is so soft and goes with anything. it can be dressed up or down. it is definitely my new ""go to"" for airplane travels. highly recommend!!"
5,I was very happy to snag this dress at such a great price! it's very easy to slip on and has a very flattering cut and color combo.
4,"The dress is beautiful! it is very long, romantic, and feminine. i am 5'10"" and it touches the ground. i tried on an xl, (normally i am a l and today i wore a size m retailer dress to work) and i could not even begin to zip the xl dress. the arms were fine. i think i would need 2-3 sizes higher. i am so sad because it is so beautiful."
4,"The tunic shown here (black and white) is the style i purchased, but not the color scheme. the one i got has a navy background with colorful large dots. the top is very cute, but has one drawback. it has covered buttons all the way down...and the top area gaps a bit so you can see your bra. i remedied the situation by sewing down the area on the placket around the top two buttons. worked like a charm! my new favorite top."
4,"I love the deep v - very flattering. bummed that it's made with polyester, but it's light and easy."
5,"First of all, i'm not a ""navy"" person at all. i much prefer black or other bright colors. i received an e'mail showing this trench last saturday and i pulled it up online and noticed how darling it looked. i didn't order it, but i went back the following day to check it out again. it was nowhere on the website. then a few days ago, back it popped up online again. i noticed it wasn't in my local store so i thought i'd go in and look this weekend. i just had to see it. i actually made it to the st"
4,"The longer back makes this one of my favorite pieces for fall. the navy blue pairs well with the floral accents on the back. this blouse is a little too sheer for my liking, but nothing a cami cannot fix."
5,This is so comfortable and flattering and hides everything but yet is fun! i actually love to wear it with jeans. and it goes great with a really great piece of jewelry.
3,"I had really high hopes for this dress, and i am still unsure if i'll keep it or not. i ordered both a small and a medium because i was unsure of this brand. the small fit (i""m usually a 4 s/m at retailer - 34b, 140 lb, 5'8"") just like it does on the model, only the photo online gives the illusion that this is a slight fit-and-flare dress. this is a shift with pleating subtleties on the bustline that bring it in slightly. also, the colors should be more like ""blue multi"" because there's a bright a"
5,"This top is so cute. a little cropped, light for a sweater tank in my opinion, and runs a little big so i sized down one size. beautiful fabric and fit, the ruffles are such a fun addition! definitely recommend with a high waisted pant or skirt for work - so cute!"
5,"Such a gorgeous top, the detail and fit are amazing. however, after wearing the top for about 8 hours, 7 of the center rinestones fell off. the beads on the sleeves also snagged the embroidery where the sleeve touches the body. but, i love the top so much, i exchanged it for another and hoping i have better luck with quality this time around."
3,"For my body type, this top looked ridiculous! i am small-busted and thinnish on top. this seemingly very pretty top look like a big rectangle on me. very unflattering. hard to tell if it was true-to-size because it hung so wide. i think for a gal with more substantial upper body (i.e., boobs) this would work better."
5,"I ordered this dress in a size 6. for reference i am 5'7"", 145 lbs. i love it! the fit is perfect. unlike other reviews, i was aware the hem was unfinished, and i like the look. the top part does not seem to short. the style, to me is kinda retro. i wore the dress with flip-flops and a large chunky necklace. i received lot's of compliments, it is my favorite dress right now!"
5,Purchased this top in navy blue. it is versatile. appropriate for the office and to go out. i specifically like the look with white jeans. it looks put together. the quality is good and there are several nice detsils in the design. highly recomnend it.
5,I am six feet tall so this will definitely be a tunic with jeans or leggings but if you are shorter it could easily be a dress. lovely pattern with soft cozy fabric. nice weight and hangs well. definitely a keeper!
5,"I bought a few of these tops in the long sleeved version during the fall/winter, so i was super excited to see the short sleeved version come out! in this brand, i can wear an xs or s - i typically wear a s in retailer tops. if you need a tee that covers your lady parts when wearing leggings, this is it! it perfectly covers my rump and looks great. it's a nice weight, too. the detailing down the back is a nice touch."
5,"Wow... i'm in love!!! when i first saw this i put it in my cart... when i went back to purchase it, it was sold out in my size... i was so bummed. i kept checking back and saw it was restocked so i quickly ordered it... thank heavens!!! when i first took it out of the box i thought it might be too ""grandma-y"" of a design... but i was wrong. it's just gorgeous! can totally be dressed up or down. so flattering. love love love it!!!"
5,"To my surprise this sweater is heavy, chic and stylish. its well made and fits tts. i'm looking forward to wearing it. i would recommend this tunic to everyone. it looks better on me than the model.....event though it doesn't look bad. you need curves to enhance the look of this tunic sweater. i really like all the different textures in this sweater."
3,"I ordered this in a size 4 and it is great quality. the only problem is the size of the slip. the top is very tight across my average chest, but fine elsewhere - odd fit. the dress fits great and i debated finding another slip, but ultimately decided to return it."
5,"The details on this blouse - lace inset in front and sheer back - look just as great in person as they do in the photos. the fabric is wonderful too; the knit has enough heft that it doesn't show every body imperfection or detail in your bra. it held up well through its first wash and ironing as well. as others have noted, the style is versatile - easy to wear with a cardigan or blazer at work or to pair with skinny jeans or shorts on the weekend. i was also positively impressed by the color sin"
4,"Super cute dress, the material is not what i expected. it's stretchy and the slip is tight fitting too. the look is super cute though!"
5,"I was really nervous when ordering this dress because of the other reviews, but i couldn't get to a store during the mother's day event and really wanted this little number. it arrived yesterday and i'm already so excited to wear it, especially once i get just a tiny bit of a tan. i love the fact that it is yellow and white stripes with the dragonflies on top--the pattern is so much cuter in person than it appears online. the fabric is also a good weight, and it is lined, which greatly simplifie"
5,"I love these jeans! i am always reluctant to change brands, but these are the best! i was pleased from the minute i took them out of the package. the fit is perfect: very skinny, but not too tight! they retain their shape over several wearings, too. the color is a great dark navy. looking forward to a long relationship with these! it's love!"
5,
5,"The model does not look as good in this shirt as it looks in real life. it is flowy, flattering, and elegant, not to mention warm and soft. i hope it holds up!"
3,They were too small for me. i loved them other than that.
5,"Warm and cozy tights for my daughter, she loves them!"
5,"This is a very pretty blouse. the fabric is lightweight and very soft. i read the other reviews and this does run very small, i ordered two sizes larger than i normally would and it fits very nicely."
5,"I love this dress. i'm 5'8"" and it fits me exactly like the model in the picture. i have slim hips and waist, so that helps. i don't think this would be as flattering on someone curvy. i wish it came in another color i like, i would absolutely buy in another color. i got a medium and it fits like a glove."
3,"Looks great on the model, but if you're curvy it looks very frumpy."
1,"While i love the fabric and the pattern, this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.
there is no mention online that there is no built in slip, and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must. (see attached photo.) even in dim lighting you can see straight through. 
also for this price point it is strange that the skirt is 'pull-on styling.' i would say that it is true to size, and i am usually a medium @ retailer, but i have a sm"
5,"I bought this dress online and have to say the material is really soft, has a great weight to it, and i bought it in the red motif. i just wore it to work this past week and received a ton of compliments on it. i wore it with black nylons black heels, and a cropped leather jacket. it is so figure flattering and so comfortable to wear. i typically range in size from an xs to a s, and the s fit me the best. i'm 5'9"" and 130 lb. it is truly a lovely dress!"
2,"This top is on the boxy side but the design is cute and i love the pink color. the problem i had with this shirt is the huge arm holes. one side you could see the top of my bra, the other side was below the side of my bra. you could also see the inside back of the shirt through this arm hole, it was that big. this went back, will not re-order. i usually order xs or xsp, this was an xsp."
5,"It's rare to find clothing made of quality fabrics, and this is a fine, soft wool blend. the design is feminine without being over-the-top, and the fit is slightly loose, as pictured on the model. i would not recommend wearing it with a belt, as pictured; it makes it look too ""trendy"" and detracts from the shape of the cardigan, which is beautiful on its own just skimming the body. it is a perfect topper and can work for daytime or an evening out. really lovely, and one of the few things i decid"
5,"This white shirt is a perfect canvas. i can dress it up with a scarf for work or wear it with my favorite jeans. it's perfect for all body shapes with the a-line. i love how comfortable this shirt feels. i like wearing this shirt with my black knit pants, and my retailers braided collar vest."
5,"I have several of these shirts and love them. i can dress them up or down, and they look great. comfortable and soft, and lose enough to be flattering but not bulky. great buy!"
3,"I bought this jumpsuit in a size medium (32d, 31 waist, 38 hips/butt). i have a jumpsuit in this style but it's silk so i was looking for one i could wear anytime. that said, even i need a heel with this jumpsuit. the problems were these: first, it was very hard to get on. very hard to tie the back, get all four panels even, tied, hiding my bra, etc. lots of fussing. your may need a partner to help. if i hadn't been doing a lot of yoga, i may not have managed. once on, the style looked great. as"
5,"This dress is a marvel. it's flattering and cute. it is great for work, a date or just a casual day. and machine washable! best thing i've ever purchased from retailer."
3,"I'm 5'9"" and 155lb. i have been wearing small a but this was realllllly small especially at my arms. it made me look like i was taking off... much more beautiful on the model. a medium would e been too big on my torso. the color is amazing! made my blonde hair really pop. i don't love green but this was so different.  would love to find something else in this color that suits me! you need to be a super skinny waif to look good in this!"
5,"This print combination is like an arts and crafts wallpaper sampler, and is simply beautiful. size down and tuck it in for the best look, but wear a high-waist bottom with it, since it runs a bit short.in the torso.i didn't find the same transparency problem of which other reviewers complain."
4,"This should be a good dress for hourglass figures. runs a bit narrow in the ribcage, so you may want to try a couple of sizes. i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37 or 38 with a 28"" underbust, 28dd/30d/32c bra. normally a 0p or 0 in these type of dresses; the size 2 fit, not sure i could have zipped a size 0.
.
loved that the boning at the front bust and sides keeps the dress up and in place without the straps. side pockets, and the cotton feels soft, more like a sateen than a poplin weave. lovely colo"
3,"I always have to try on tops of retailer. i know this, and yet i ordered a top through the website anyway. i don't think i'll do it again. the drape of the top seen in the pictures did not translate in real life because the top scratched up pretty quickly. ironically, when i washed it (according to directions) it also shrunk quite a bit."
5,"I picked this top hoping that it would go with the dipped horizon skirt and the color was a perfect match! i love the irregularities in the dye, and the woven back. the cut is boxy, but the fabric is soft and drapes well so very flattering. looks great with white jeans"
5,"I have had a problem finding jeans that fit properly (that i don't have to pull up every single time i walk up the stairs or stand up) but these are perfect. they are made with a bit of a stretchy material, yet keep their shape well. i am 5'7, 130 pounds, athletic body type and got a size 25. the only thing i am worried about is the dark color bleeding onto a light colored couch/quilt/purse/etc. as this has happened to me before with dark wash jeans."
2,"I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big.   i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent. with all of the extra material in the back, it billowed out in all the wrong places. the material is comfy and it's a very cute concept, just didn't work for me."
5,These tight cords are perfect for fall.
4,"I saw this coat online and loved it. the blue collar is great. the length is great, fits over bottom. it is quite warm. the arms are a little tight but they loosen up. the sale price plus 40% off was the ticket."
4,"I love this color blue. when this item went on sale i had to grab it and i'm glad i did. it feels medium weight to me so i could throw this on, on a cool summer night and also in the fall. there is some sparkle to the fabric which i think is really a nice added touch. feels comfortable on and looks adorable."
5,This dress runs large so i sized down. when it arrived i looked at it and thought the fabric was ugly and boring for a dress. it sat there for about two weeks till i tried it on. i love it! it is so comfortable and is so cute how the pockets hang. all it need is some long necklaces or a scarf to complete the look. i get complements on it everytime i wear it. my only complaint is that it peels under the arms a little bit.
4,"The design and colors on this sweater arguably make it a ""statement sweater"". it has a modified raglan type sleeve. i found the sleeves to fit just fine. for reference, i am 5'9"", 150 lbs., 34dddd, and the medium fit perfectly. it is not a long sweater and, with my height, i wear a long tank top or cami underneath. i love the way it looks."
4,"I picked this up in the store during the retailer weekend sale. i used to have a similar long black stretchy skirt that i wore until it fell apart. things i really like about this skirt are that it's basic black, but has some interest in the small swiss dots in the top layer, and it's stretchy. the yoga-pant-waistband seems like it will be very comfy and also allows you to adjust the skirt length a little bit, depending on whether/how much you fold it down. it is lined, which is a big plus. i was"
5,"Love this skirt! very fun and feminine. it is a great fit and i love the layering contrast of stripes. length goes right to below my knees, which is perfect for me! i am petite and curvy."
5,"These pants are so great, light, comfortable and reasonably priced. they are very well made, and the soft fabric is perfect for summer traveling and hiking. there's a bit of elastic in the waist which i like since pants usually gap at the waist on me. they're like classier lounge pants."
5,"I was intrigued by this vest on-line but really wanted to try it on first before i purchased it. stopped into my local retailer store today and was happy to see they had it in stock. i am typically a 10/12 and purchased this in the m/l. this picture does not give the vest justice in terms of the way it falls, which to me is what makes a vest a success or not. also, the colors are great. i was wearing a cream sweater and black pants when i tried it on, went great with those colors but i think it wi"
4,"These are nice, flattering bra with light to medium suport. however the colors and patters are not quite as pictured. i almost suspect they are slightly different on each bra. exmaple: on the picture online the left side seems to be a light blue and the right one orange. on the bra i received the left side is a darker, bluishgreen color. the right side is orange and light purple. i would hae prefered the colors on the photo but it is not a big deal i guess. i ordered the color block shorts as we"
5,I love this tee. it is light weight and fits perfectly. the additional accents like cuff work and detail around the neck makes it original.
5,"This sweater fits differently than it looks on the model in the photo. it is more fitted, less bell sleeve. and the neck is less boat-neck on me. i am often between sizes at retailer, but in this one i got the larger size and it fits well. i love this sweater. i just wanted to mention that i think it fits differently than what it looks like in the pic."
5,"I am usually between a 8 and a 10 and was an 8 in this skirt, it is very nice because it has so many soft colors in it and will go with anything. i live in florida so for me this is a fall skirt! i like the look of a wrap and it is not a wrap it fits great."
4,"I do think the fabric could be a little more substantial for the price, and was disappoitned that even petites, were again, too long... the color is nice enough (neutral), and they definitely look like work pants. they are true to sice, but i could do the low end of my size range."
5,I love the design of this top.  the pattern is beautiful and the back unique.   i am a mom of two so i really appreciate the extra front coverage.  i can run around at the beach with my kids and not be worried about overexposure.  i am a 34d on top and purchased the large and it fits well.
5,"I bought this top in a small and it was true to size. loved that it wasn't too fitted across the back, but was still able to show a bit of body with the drawstring by the waist. it will become a wardrobe staple during the hot months in dallas."
2,"Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me, thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller."
4,"Great looking, please dry clean it or you'll ruin it, fits well, easy to make an outfit look stylish"
3,"I usually wear petite which this was not so a little big for me. but nice color and good quality, but pricey for what it is. it's more like a $45 sweater not $100+"
5,Great long cardigan! i wear this with a simple tank
2,"I ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me. i'm usually fine with the petite sizing, but this didn't work and i'm so bummed. the dress is soft, the blue color is gorgeous, but it fits like a bag. i wanted to love this, but sadly will have to return. i think someone with curves will love this dress. it is really beautiful quality, just does not fit a petite frame."
4,Great soft tee. got the blue and really love the color.
5,"I love everything about this tee. it has wonderful detailing that makes it different from other tees. the fabric is soft, and the tee is very comfortable. i disagree with some of the other reviews about the colors. i actually love both colors. the red is a nice slightly brownish red. i wore that color with a pair of plaid (white, teal, & taupe) shorts, and i got compliments on my outfit. the color will go with more than one might think. i haven't worn the green one yet. i hope this tee comes bac"
2,I was so sure i was going to love this dress when i saw it on the rack. i was so disappointed by how poofy on the bottom. it was not flattering at all! i'd love to see this pattern back with a better fit.
4,"Although it was a bit of a battle with my bra straps, it was completely worth it for date night. hot shirt! very comfy and quality fabric. next time, i may just pin or tape my straps..."
2,Runs large and it also had a small hole in the back had to return it.
2,"I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn't for me. the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable. the fit is not quite right on me. the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt. i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not. it was not very comfortable for me either, so this was clearly not a win for me."
5,"Is this dress ever flattering! i have seen many variations of this kind of dress-some where they will kris-cross over the breast area, some where they will have a single twist-but i never have seen one like this with a double twist and oh, what a difference it makes. i particularly love this in blue-which was a very bright royal color in-store. i am not very chesty, so the accenting in that area is very flattering on me and made me fall in love."
5,"This dress is so much prettier in person - the pattern is unique, adorable and not over-powering. i'm an xxs petite and i can wear the dress with flats. (5ft) i think this is versatile enough to wear to work, party or a casual wedding. the fit is perfect - hugs at the correct spots. the fabric feels really soft and silky and feels a bit heavy which allows it to drape nicely. overall - i love it."
5,"This is a great dress for all body types. the fabric is substantial and soft.  i sized down for a closer fit, but i could have also bought my usual medium and had the extra space to belt it and wear a looser fit. i busted out the boots, a little early, and the outfit was done.  super easy to wear, dressed up or dressed down.  totally worth the price, i'm glad i didn't wait until it went on sale for fear of selling out."
5,Very nice top. flattering and goes with everything. i bought the medium in the green but would have needed the large in the white as the white was a little see through and showed more of my flaws. i agree with the other reviewer in that this top has good button placement.
5,"Great fabric and nice cut - like other reviewer said, fitted but not too....but it was just too short for my legs. i do wonder if the description is wrong but i didn't keep it long enough to measure and check this."
5,"I cannot even tell you how many pairs of white jeans i have tried on in my quest to find white jeans! all brands and all styles and finally i took a chance on these and have found the ones! these are great quality, as true for any ag pants i have ever purchased. they are a crisp white and are not see through and the fit is amazing! i have athletic legs and with my muscular thighs and calves it has been difficult to find a pair of white jeans that didn't hug to tightly and therefore fitting poorl"
4,"I finally bought this top after eyeing it in the store for sometime. the design adds a bit of edge to a top that could get matronly very quickly. it goes great with a nice pair of jeans and some pumps - you're ready for a night out! my only critique is that i'm a bit busty (38c) so in the center of the top where the v of the neckline meets the shirt, there is some pulling. it's not completely noticeable, and doesn't make it uncomfortable in the least. love this shirt and so happy i finally indul"
4,I purchased this adorable dress to wear on vacation. it's such a cute fun print. i purchased my regular size xs and it's a good fit. the material is a little stiff but the print makes up for it. got it during the 25 percent promo ..
3,"The model makes this dress look amazing, but it didn't translate that way on me. the print is really beautiful, i loved that, but the waist is huge and the skirt part is a-line and full, not streamlined like it looks on the model. if it was more like that this dress would be a hit. but, sadly, it's a miss. this is something your mom would love on you, but few others."
1,"So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3"" and 120 pounds. when i put it on, all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed, i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering."
4,"Although it kind of ran big and the material is stiff causing some protrusion off my shoulders, i decided to keep it only because it was unique and still looked cute"
5,"This top is absolutely gorgeous!! i ordered in xs and unfortunately could not button it, too tight. for reference i am 5-3"", 120 lbs, 34b. i will definately be exchanging it for a size s, i just love how classy and glamorous this top is. i do wish it were a few inches longer, but it still looks so nice. i agree with other reviewer how nice it will go over a cocktail dress. hoping the size s has a better fit on me!"
5,Beautiful choice...beautiful fit for my daughter's slim body
4,Great coat. love the length but it definitely runs big. i got a m even though i would normally be a l and it's roomy. fabric has pulles under the arms after 1 wear but overall quality is good. very warm. great look for work w. black pants.
5,"Totally out of my style range but am totally enamored by this tent dress/shirt/coat thing! ok, so yes it's very very tenty, but fits on my shoulders (size down 1x or 2x if you're narrow shouldered) and i use one of my leather belts to gather the material and make myself a nice western fit & flare! like the model shots, this looks great with a tee and skinnies. if you have tried the marvelous silk santee swing dress, the escalante has the same amount of fabric that reviewer either love or hate. i"
5,Just bought the patterned and gray. the small fit perfect. i do have a short torso though. chest size 32dd. i tried the medium but then the underarm portion was too wide. i might have gotten a medium petite but small petite would have been too small i think. i hope the quality holds up which was the only thing i wasn't sure of. great summer tank to throw on with jeans or shorts.
4,"Very soft material, probably will pill quickly but it is super comfortable. it is also very low cut; it works perfectly for me for breastfeeding because each of the front panels can be easily pulled to the side. a cami underneath is required, the model definitely isn't wearing a bra. i'll be wearing a nursing tank under this. definitely a good print for summer."
4,"This top is lovely and so perfect for this time of year when you want to look fall-ish but when it's still too hot to wear long sleeves. but i'm pretty sure it's navy, not black. very dark navy, yes. still, not black. compared to every other black top in my closet it looks navy. so that was a little disappointing. but i'm keeping it because i'm a sucker for a flowy top, and i can wear it right now."
4,"Great fit, a little stiff. i typically wear a 4, and was able to take a 2 in this skirt, though a 4 would probably have been fine! it's just a fun skirt, with a little shimmer to dress up an outfit."
4,I usually wear an xxsp in retailer brands. i bought this jacket in a regular size 0 and it fits like a glove. even the sleeves are the right length. it really accents my narrow waist. i imagine it runs very small for those who wear regular sizes. if you are petite this is the jacket for you. the jacket is unlined so i cant wear it in cold weather. it is very nice over a dress with black boots and with skinny jeans. i receive complements every time i wear this item!
5,"I bought the white and olive today. i usually get a size s, but opted for the xs for this shirt. i am longer torsoed than perhaps average, so it came to just below mid-butt, which i like. my shoulders are on the broader side and a bit muscular, but even still the xs was perfect and cute, rather than just comfy. def an undershirt is needed for these, but i run cold, so i nearly always have an undershirt. the fabric is just nice enough that i could wear the shirt with a fun, nice skirt with a high"
2,"I really wanted to love this dress, but it just didn't fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite, and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless, and that's what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric, great color combo, bad fit."
4,"I love swing dresses and normally order l , but this one turned out to be way too large. and as other customers said the sleeves are short , so the whole look is out of proportion. the colors are much brighter than they appear in the photo. the dark patches are a bright peacock color and the hot pink is just too much for my taste.the material design is not as classy looking as it comes across on line.so sad because i love this dress pictured on line and this is not it. 
the quality of the slip"
5,"Very pleased with this top. i got the blue and white first and now i'm getting the red and white. the material is comfy and not sheer, and the slits at the side and the zipper in back add extra style."
5,"This is a very well made swimsuit with soft foam cups and fully lined. the shoulders stay put with thin strips of foam that are sewn in. very comfortable and easy to move in; my arms have full range. the color is like the online photo, and to the teal close-up i posted of the shoulder area.
.
the size 'm' that i ordered fit my bust very well with smooth lines and decent support. i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37, 30d / 32c bra, with a average to long torso with a full bottom and thighs. i think the"
5,"I don't normally spend so much on t shirts but this one is worth it. really well made and quite unique. i reckon i'll get a lot of use out of it,"
5,"This tank is super amazing. very versatile - wore to work with dress pants and flats, and wore out to dinner with jeans and heels. a bit out of my comfort zone since it is a ""swing"" tank, but love the color and cut! perfect for professional life and going out on the town. i did choose a petite in this due to the long armholes (even though i have a long torso for my body size)."
5,"I bought this tunic today because it paired well with patterned slim pants. at 5'2"" the tunic felt like it added height and even though i'm a 34f the top fit well across the bust. i tried on the large first, and it felt very comfortable but a bit big. the medium fit a little more snugly, but was more proportional in the arms, so i purchased it instead.
the neckline is not too low and does not require a camisole under and the buttons add a nice weight so that the top drapes towards my chest inst"
5,This is a wonderful vest! i love the lining!! keeps you nice and warm! i love the muted green color! the pockets are sewn closed but can be cut open at the stitching without ruining the vest!!
5,"Joggers are my new style this spring/summer i think. i love the simplicity of this style. the cut is perfect, very true to size. i like the longer length - perfect to wear with kitten heels, flats, or slip on canvas. this color especially is really versatile and make them my go to pants once a week for a perfectly put together outfit."
5,"Very soft and comfortable. the shirt has an unusual, asymmetrical seam that appears along the front, right-hand side of the garment. (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam.) i actually like the seam - it creates more visual interest, and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done - there are two layers that form the cowl, and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun"
5,"I got these in gray. like other reviewers mentioned, the waist is a little higher (not 70s though) but the jean had great control so it ""holds"" everything in instead of creating a muffin top which many shorter waisted jeans do. contours to the leg. love it!"
5,"The only thing i did not like about this jacket was that i could not find it in my size before it sold out! retailer, please bring back another iteration for spring!"
5,"I love the look of this dress when it's on. the only issue i have with it is that the inside of the dress is white, which shows through on the chest slightly, but it's such a pretty dress and such an overall great fit, that i'm keeping it anyway!"
5,I love this sweater. the green is soft. the fabric is light enough for year round in my area. i thought it might be too young but it works nicely for me. i bought it in two other colors when the package arrived today.
5,"Beautiful cardigan, but it does run large.  i'm about 5'9"", 160 lbs, normally a large in tops, and the medium fits great. it's still a bit roomy, but i think this cardigan is meant to be a tad roomy.  i agree with another reviewer that it's a bit itchy on bare skin, but it's wool, so that's a given.  overall, a great cardigan for fall!"
5,"The most important thing to note about this skirt is that it is a true blue color- not black! it's also perfect for spring , summer and early fall. super comfy, casual yet elegant. size runs a tiny bit small as the waist is not elasticized. a staple of a cozy chic wardrobe."
2,I saw this on a mannequin in the store and so wanted it to work but was just too oversized and bulky. very good quality and material.
2,"I saw this on sale, and it looked lovely online. i really wanted to love it when i received it. it looked great, but once i tried it on, it bunches up in the back. it looks awkward. the lace and small details are pretty, but the fit is just off. returned it in the store."
5,"I live in these shorts all summer long. they are so comfortable, soft and practical. i have purchased a couple of these every summer but this year they were so many pretty colors i ended up with 6 new pair.. they go with just about everything and are soft and perfect for texas heat. i stayed true to size on them."
5,"This is a beautiful top. i purchased this in the green/moss color. it's reminds me of a vintage looking blue-green. it fits generously, has more of a swing style to it. i love it! i think it is romantic and feminine. glad i made the purchase. simply beautiful."
5,"The stress is a simple basic. i got it in the navy stripe and have worn it with the long gray scarf, similar to pictured. it is very soft and comfortable."
1,"This dress ran large--maybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy. the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body, maybe because i have a short torso/petite frame. i loved the yellow color for summer--it would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding. unfortunately, i had to return it."
4,"This skirt is a great staple. i somewhat agree with the first reviewer that it is a little big but not huge. i bought a m which is my regular size and i have to have it shorten the length, but that is typical for me since i am very short, but i liked the waist and didn't feel like it was too big and i have a very small waist. i don't like tight elastic at the waist and this sat very comfortably on me. nice heavy material for the winter."
4,
5,"I purchased this dress in the berry color. it is beautiful and feminine. the length fit just like in the picture. i love all the detail and ease of this dress. i'm 5'2"" 34d and purchased a size 2. it fits true to size."
5,"This dress is super comfy and really cute! i was worried that the horizontal stripes might not be flattering, but they didn't make me look larger at all. it's great for casual wear, but can easily be dressed up with a jacket and booties."
5,"Runs true to size, with allowance for some bulky clothing underneath for those cool fall days. definitely not meant for winter - so don't plan on this for freezing cold days. the bottom falls nicely over the hips and the color is vibrant and adds some life to any outfit."
5,This is such a beautiful dress. fell in love with it at first sight. it is very pretty. can be dressed up or down .. comes with an attached slip that is a tad longer than the dress and it shows on the bottom.. darling dress that will get lots of use this summer.
4,I bought this dress on super sale online after seeing it in the store. the pattern is just so beautiful and unique! i think it looks much pretty in person than online. there isn't a lot of shape to the dress but i like the loose style and can see this being worn with boots/booties. it also looks nice with a belt! my only complaint is i had to size down to a 6 (usually an 8-10 in dresses) and the liner slip was a little tight. also would have loved to try this in petite. the regular falls to just
5,"This dress is of excellent quality, made from fairly heavy fabric. the drape of the dress is beautiful - the dress definitely works if you're tall and slender. i'm 5'9, 32b, 125lbs, and i have the xs."
5,"This was my favorite piece in my order. it fit so well that i immediately went online to see if they had other colors. they don't. i voice the other reviewers opinion: get more colors in of this style. i would order in a heartbeat. i plan on wearing this to work (it's freezing in my office) but it is versatile enough to pair with jeans for a casual look. the material was soft, woven tightly (a good thing) and well made. good one retailer! definitely a keeper."
4,"This shirt is pretty but wasn't worth the price in my opinion. the shirt does a pretty decent job of staying closed at least, and the embroidering is pretty, but i could tell the material wouldn't last very long.

also i like my shirts loose fitting, but this one looks more boxy than flowy. i'd probably still buy it if it were cheaper."
4,"I agree with the other reviews that the side slits are not at all represented in the images. thankfully there was an instagram photo of the coat posted by the time i ordered it that showed the side panels very clearly, so i was not caught off guard. i like that the panels allow for ease of movement, but when there's a cold wind it would be nice if they were not there. this coat is a great statement piece for a night out, just not as much for day to day wear if you're looking for something warm a"
4,"I was so excited to see this on sale, with an extra 25% off! no brainer. i bought the cream color which is the most beautiful sand color. just as shown. it is super soft and thin. a good quality thin knit. it's just too long for me. it just doesn't quite look right on me. i still have to give it a high rating because it is truly exactly as pictured. i'm 5'9 and it hits just above my knees and the slit runs up to my belt. if i could knock 3inches off this i'd have it in every color."
4,This dress is really simple and elegant and i want to love it but i'm having a hard time getting it to fit right. i'm normally a size 4/6 and i bought this in an 8 and couldn't zip it up. i'm a 36d which is part of the problem so i exchanged it for a 10 and i can now zip it but the bar in the back i thought would cover my bra strap but like other reviewers mentioned its a bit high. most of my bras fall right into the hole beneath the bar. its unfortunate because i wanted to love this dress. i mi
5,"I love love love these bright red jeans. they fit great, they're super soft and comfortable, and the bright red is a great punch of color. only sad about how expensive they are. at that price point, i decided to return them, but am hoping they get marked down!"
5,"Adorable sweater with a loose knit that helps slim down my man-back appearance. cut is tapered to the body but with a soft flare at the bottom hem. not clingy, very soft fabric doesn't accentuate bulges so i am happy about it's forgiving silhouette."
5,"I want this in every color! fits tts...so comfortable, flattering, and fabric feels like it will hold up well (fingers crossed). love love love."
4,"I was looking for a cross between a light, fall-wool jacket and a cardigan and this is it! the red version looks festive in the winter, and the hood adds a bit of spunk. looks great both open and buttoned. i received many compliments on this the first time i wore it."
3,"Cute dress- flattering and seems to be well made. however, when i received it it seemed that it had been worn. the bottom was all dirty and it had a white mark at the top. called and rep said they would send new dress if i send first back, so hopefully that gets here quickly and in good shape. the other dress i place with my order hasn't even shipped and the rep couldn't tell me when/if it would."
5,"I got this skirt because its elegant and can be worn in three seasons. it is stylish and can easily be dressed up or down. i usually wear an xs in bottoms and this runs about one size large in the waist area. still, i am keeping it and plan to have it altered. it is cute and completely worth the extra effort"
4,"Soft, comfortable and well made. great with sleeves rolled or down for cooler weather. interesting color- close to picture, maybe a little more orange. goes well with blues and grays."
3,"Purchased this should in the blue motif in size small. i am usually between a small and medium in shirts, 36c broad shoulders. the fit was fine in the small. however, i had a few issues with the top: 1) the blue motif looked actually like a faded blue (as if it had been washed quite a few times and looked worn), 2) the front mid/bottom section laid strangely and gave me a maternity look, and 3) the back has alot of fabric (see back of tank in white motif) and was very voluminous. for me, it wasn"
5,"I purchased the gray motif with the bright flower design. i have owned many blouses in my lifetime, but i must say this is one of the best fitting and most attractive of most any i have ever owned. it falls just right on my body and is smooth and luxurious with a silky feel. the cuffs fall on my wrists just perfectly. the color is just right for my fair skin and light hair. this was my first order from you and if this is any indication of the quality and fit i will receive i'll do a lot more ord"
2,"I had my eye on this one for awhile and decided to buy it when it popped back on my wishlist. i can see why someone returned it. the sweater top hits at the worst possible spot and made me look ridiculous, like a mushroom top. from the side i saw the potential, but not enough to save it. probably one of the worst things i have ever purchased from retailer."
5,Lightweight warm in cold nice as a day jacket. works well as a casual coat. very soft but a little wooly. it's really nice color. thinking about buying another. i got the dark one.
3,"They are beautiful! they fit amazingly! they ripped on a seam the third time i wore them. i kept wearing them, because again, the fit! the style! alas, about the fifth time i wore them, the other leg ripped at the knee seam. they are just totally falling apart. it's so very sad. i would wear them alllll the time if they could bear it. i'm actually thinking of buying another pair because i love them soooo, but it would likely be wasted cash as i believe there is a real manufacturing issue here. w"
5,I purchased this item as a gift for my wife and she loves it. the quality for the price is great. soft and comfortable. needs to be washed with care but is worth it
1,"I thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high. in fact, two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid. however, as we were looking at the items, we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality, as the previous reviewer noted. therefore, none of us purchased the pants.

the staff at the store were very helpful"
1,This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came!
3,"I love this dress now that it is on sale; sized down to sm petite, added a simple full slip. endless compliments and inquiries on where to buy it!"
4,"I generally wear a size 6, and am 5 ft 3 in in height. the size 6 fell below the knees and did not look right. the fit of the 6 petite is beautiful and flattering. the dress is indeed lovely, and i really want to love this dress as much as others do... however, i am conflicted. i am modest in my style, and even though nothing is revealed, the strategic placement of lace panels makes it a bit suggestive, and takes it out of my comfort zone."
2,"I ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews, but i don't agree. these are going back. i ordered a small. i'm 5'5"" and 135 pounds. i am usually between a small and a medium in pants, but the small in these pants is huge. i could definitely fit into an xs. but i also don't think they are very flattering and don't like the feel of the fabric. it's too bad. i love the idea of these."
5,"I love this tunic! it has an unusual neckline with decorative stitching and beautiful buttons,.i like the slight sheen of the fabric as well. wearing it makes me feel elegant without sacrificing comfort. i'm going to wear it for work with black leggings and on weekends with jeans; i suspect it will also be great to travel in. the only potential downsides might be the deep side slit and the fact that it has to be dry cleaned."
5,Great cut and high quality fabric. the top gives you a nice hourglass shape and i love the way it hangs half-way down your butt.
4,"I have a few of these tees in the short sleeve version and found myself wearing them pretty often so i jumped on the long sleeve option when it went on sale. i bought the black and red (which is more of an orangey red). i love them as well! this top drapes nicely and has a little more style than just a plain tee. the material is thin and while that is nice for breeziness sake, i don't anticipate this will last that long, but thats cool...its not a real investment piece but rather a cute casual t"
4,"I agree with other reviewers, this print is beautiful, i'd love to see the artists other work...
however, the price is steep for sure!
i was hoping to wear this with my skinny jeans but it is waaaay too short for that! i have an extra long torso so this is not an unusual problem for me, but this one is worse than usual almost like a crop top. unlike other reviewers tho, i would not want to size up. it fits snugly but not tight. the fabric doesn't give much tho, so if you're on the verge of siz"
5,"I've been waiting for this dress to come back in stock and when it finally did i got it in the size 2. i'm typically a 2 or 4 in dresses and the 2 fits perfect. for reference i'm 5'6, 34c, 130lb. i think it runs on a larger size because it's a shift dress. i would recommend sizing down. a great white dress to wear to my rehearsal dinner!"
5,"This dress is very forgiving on my post baby body. i'm glad i purchased the petite, it hits my ankle perfectly (i'm 5'5""). very versatile, i can see wearing this at work (with a blazer) or on a weekend."
1,I was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person. it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the 90s with the red and white ruffles. pass!

5,"Wanted a jumpsuit that didn't look stupid on a 50+ year old -- this is it! ordered a large and it is a little loose around the waist, but still fits and is comfortable. extremely well made and very cute. the only complaint is that it is difficult to tie the back."
4,"This is a very cute and unique top!! i absolutely love the back, which makes up for my indifference of the front. i'm a little heavier in the middle, so it hides it a bit, but the light blue from the back that shows on the sides makes me feel a little wider. it's not perfect, but i like it enough to keep it. i got lots of compliments on it when i wore it. it's very comfortable too. i just wish the front had a little more to it or was a tad longer. overall very happy."
5,"This blouse is pretty and drapes wonderfully. i don't think it's too wide at all. it's soft and comfortable. it's stretchy, yet with quality fabric that should keep its shape. definitely a classic piece. the sale price makes the cost more appropriate. the white is a little transparent, but with a tank, it's not a problem. the black is beautiful. i'm having a hard time choosing between them. i love the cut and sleeve details. it wouldn't have looked right with less fabric. it's needed for the sty"
1,"Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5""4, weigh around 120 lb, and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing, depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning."
5,"I adore this dress! as a mom of two under 2, i need things that are cute, but no-fuss. this is exactly that piece! beautifully lined, breezy linen fabric, machine-washable, and flattering. the catch is finding the right size to flatter. i'm 5'7 and 128...found my normal size small to be really big everywhere. i went with the xs to avoid issues in the shoulders, but i maybe could have gone even smaller. fabric doesn't have a lot of give, so if you are large in the chest, my guess would be a possi"
4,"For a special occasion, but i didn't keep mine:

i ordered petite and it was short on me, too short for my comfort 
color is nice, rsty burgundy, i expected it a little more 'red""
fastening is a little more complicated, though you don't have to make it complicated, it has hooks at each end of the hole in the back,.

but: it is a nice cut, flattering to the silhouette, i might order a regualr size if i needed it. the body is structured, mateiral is not stiff, but also not soft. the arms is"
5,"I bought this during the 25% off dress sale, but alas it is a chemise and not a dress. nevertheless i love it. in a smaller size (i exchanged an xs for an xxs) it is much more flattering and has more shape. the different fabrics make it interesting and fun."
5,"Tried it on in store and had to have it. so soft and easy to throw on. i'm 5'6"" and it hits at the knee. i usually wear an xs or small in tops and the xs fit great."
4,"I ordered the mustard yellow in 10 and found the shirt to fit true to size. it works great with a skirt and with jeans but i did need to wear it with high rise jeans otherwise it came right to the top of my normal jeans and i didn't want to risk showing any skin at work. 

the color is amazing and looks good with just about any color bottom so there is a lot of room to have fun with the top. 

being larger on top the ruffles did not bother me at all, but rather act like an accessory - i find"
5,"This dress is really beautiful. i was looking for something to wear to a summer 6 o'clock wedding, and this dress will work perfectly. the fabric is smooth and has a tiny bit of sheen to it which makes it look a little nicer and more formal. however, you can easily dress it down. my only issue was the length. i'm 5'4 and this dress was way too long. definitely need to take off about 5 or 6 inches! i also had to size up. i could have tried the petite, but it fit so well everywhere except length,"
3,I ordered the large since the med wasn't available and it didn't complement my figure because it was too loose all over. i like the design detail with off-center buttons and the fabric is a nice quality.
5,I am 125lbs and purchased the petiite small. the dress is very flattering and can easily be dressed up or down. the fabric is a medium weight and does not cling to trouble areas.
5,"I was hesitant to buy this top after reading previous reviews, but i love it! granted, i am two months postpartum so i am looking for tops that are airy (it's summer in socal) but cover up my tummy. the material is soft and stretchy and it does have a loose shelf bra type inset---so not a real bra but at least something there. i wore a free people bralette with it and it looked perfect! really happy with this top!"
5,"These pants are flattering yet comfortable. i am thrilled that they are available in tall sizes because i am 6 feet tall. the 36 inch inseam is perfect and for me prevents the problem of ""high water"" pants. the zippered pockets are flattering yet useful. the high rise waist is wonderful. these pants are perfect for wear in a number of occasions. they are great."
4,"I love this shirt for a throw on and go.  hangs nicely and fits great.  colors are more vibrant in person.  i love mauve, i think they do a great job with their designs!"
5,"I am happy with my decision to buy this dress! it's casual, comfortable and my favorite color, too. this product is true to size, color and the material feels great."
5,"To be honest, i bought this as a pregnancy top since i can't bring myself to buy actual maternity wear. it is gorgeously made of lovely light material, and i can actually see myself wearing it even after baby. i find the asymmetrical hemline to be really chic - overall a fave."
5,
5,"I have come to scoop up basically ever elevenses jumpsuit that they release because they are perfection - always the perfect fit and quality fabric. i'm on the taller side at 5'7"" and found this to fit perfectly, yet somehow it looks equally as perfect on shorter ladies i saw in the dressing room. awesome!"
3,"I ordered this online and i love the style, but didn't like the print as much as i thought i would."
5,I purchased this dress in black a few months back. i was so excited to see it back in multiple colors! the black dress went well with riding boots and tights for colder temps. the yellow dress will be great in warm temps with cute sandals. super comfortable and flattering.
5,"I'm glad i tried this on. i was drawn to the burgundy and pink floral print, but i wasn't so sure about the cut or style of the top. once it was on, however, i loved it. i don't much care for the a-line tops that remind me of maternity wear. they're cute on rail-thin, young girls, but not so much on mom-bod women in their 40s. this top is the exception. the details from the buttons to the thin pleats, the unique cut of the bust-line and the print make this top both lovely and flattering. i wore"
5,
4,"So, i bought these in 31 --my regular size in hei-hei and they were huge. so, now i am not sure if i should go for a 30 or 29? i guess i will try the 30. they are really soft and very cute pants. just the sizing is difficult."
2,"I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery . i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals. i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy. unfortunately this dress is huge. it is a rectangle with pockets. i bought the xxsp, my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me.this dress was beyond alterations. too bad it was a great idea but no"
3,"I just sent this back. it is very cute & the fabric is great, so soft & comfy, but it doesn't work with my shape. it is extremely swingy in shape and the buttons up the front only work if you don't have a large chest. on me, it looks like maternity and it gaps when i button it. am a 34dd. it's not the fault of the top, but a bigger size would have swallowed me. i think if you are thin and also not top-heavy like the model, this will be adorable on you. i am just too busty."
5,
5,"Putting my two cents in regarding how fantastic this dress is! i bought the medium petite in navy stripe. it fits great, it's not too clingy and it's flattering to my disproportionate figure (makes me look more hourglass)."
5,"Love this! it's loose and easy for summer, fabric is not too sheer. the asymmetrical ruffle is such a cute feature. washes well. i got the pink for myself (though it's a deep coral color - perfect for me) and the gray for my daughter. wish they'd had the powder blue when i bought ours; i'd have bought that color for her instead."
5,
5,"I so wanted this top in red, and tried on the 0, but it was a little big/long on my 5'1.5"" frame #115 lbs, 30dd#, i tried ordering 0petite, but it was sold out. te only one available was the honey color, so i decided to try it, even though i am very pale... well, i actually do like it. it isn't as popping as the red, but it is super flattering, and the color is actually classy,... so i feel like i could wear this with a dressier outfit, not just casual. i love the feel, the fabric is airy, great"
5,"I love this tee, the fabric is very comfortable and the v-neck is not too deep for petites!"
1,I'm 5 ft 7 125 lbs true size 4 and these pants made me look like i had boy parts. super disappointed!
5,"I got this top in the black and i love it. the bottom is a silky material that's really beautiful, and the cutout details are really pretty. so many of retailer's sweaters are enormous, but this one fits tts. 

my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily."
3,"Note: if you have a large chest, the seams hit in an unflattering spot. nice shirt, just not great for the price."
5,Good quality and design. perfect for casual office. definitely recommend. i don't know why it's called a cardigan because it's more like a casual blazer. note there is no button- just the tie to close. runs big. i'm 5'8'' 130# ordered the xs and it's roomy.
4,"The fabric is quality, nice thicker fabric. the fit was strange, the top part fit great through the arms and shoulders, except my bust makes the front stick out and results in a maternity look. it was also slightly wide, i considered taking it in on the sides. ultimately it wouldn't be worth the money. it would be a great top for someone with a smaller chest."
5,Adorable dress. could hardly get the zipper up in my very typical size 4. i will order a 6 and am hoping it will work out!
4,This is a beautiful piece for the price. very well made and flattering. i'm a 34c and usually wear a size 2-4 on top and solid size 4 on bottom. a size small in this fit great. it does not provide any support up top though so be aware of that.
3,"The dress is precious and looks good on all body types. however, the bust is extremely tight. i had to go up a dress size just to fit in the chest area."
4,I ordered a size xl in ivory. it's prettier in person. there are great details. it shrunk a bit after washing and air-drying. i cut off the layer of chiffon around the neckline to make it more comfortable. a cute summer tank.
5,Love it. goes well with a lot. super soft
5,"I love this sweater! aside from it being absolutely adorable, the quality is great and the sizing is accurate. i have received so many compliments on it so far and honestly, i want to wear it everyday! the sweater is super soft and comfy... and of course, i totally recommend it! thanks retailer!!"
2,"Material is thin, with a fleece like feeling on the inside. hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material. the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward, shows way too much, would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath."
4,This dress is beautiful and flowy but flattering. the colors are vibrant. the slip is tighter than the dress but i don't mind. it is a half slip and the bottom is sheer. i'm normally a 10/12 in dress and the 12 fit well. the length was good for my 5'9 height.
5,"I didn't look at this dress twice online but when i tried it on in the store i was floored. it was beautiful, flattering, and so much fun."
5,
5,"I thought this dress looked cute online and was excited to try it on at my local retailer. it fits so well and is very flattering! i really like the material. 

the only thing for me is that i have long arms so the sleeves have to get pushed up, but it looks like that's how it's supposed to be."
5,"This top is very well made. nice heavy material for those in between days. the back is slightly longer than the front and it is well finished inside. i ordered a 00 which fits great in the body area, but a little tight on my arms. still a keeper!"
3,"The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders, but that was kind of snug, perhaps why it didn't fit right, it is not off the shoulders on this picture. the cut is loose, so it looked big on me, but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on... may give it another try on. xs was big, so would need to try the xxs next time. but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me!

colors are nice, light, but appropriate for fall (or summer!) light fabri"
5,"Love the length, color, and rise. new favorite jeans! they're a little loose around the ankle and the way they hang is the only thing i don't like."
5,"This runs tts - maybe a little on the large side. i typically wear between a small and a medium (or 6 and 8), and the small was a perfect fit. this is my second jumpsuit and i always worry about how easy they are to pull down for restroom breaks. (i drink a ton of water) this one is relatively easy - it has a button at the back neck that you have to unfasten and it's super easy and not awkward at all. i love how you can dress this up with heels for a night out or pair with sandals for a more cau"
5,"I purchased both the floral sleep shorts and the top. the floral watercolor pattern is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft. like the other reviewers, i appreciate the feminine quality of this set while also being able to run around the house. i am 135 lbs and purchased a s."
5,"I am so glad i had read the other reviews of this jacket which prompted me to order. great fit and cut with a hint of stretch, nice styling details, great vintage color. i wasn't in love with the price but after receiving the jacket i would gladly pay the price again. will definitely be in my wardrobe rotation for years to come!"
5,"The skirt looked orange online, but is more of a nice red (i do like orange too though).
i had orginially palced this in my basket as a to order later to see, but my store had it. glad because i would have ordered petite, adn i do think that would have been too short for me (not appropirate for work or (in my opinion0, my age). the skirt (size 0 regular), fit my waste, and fell about one inch above my knee. i am 5'1.5"" (115 lbs if it helps#... so petite would have been short.

the only thing tha"
4,This tunic is a nice basic to have. it is like a light sweater knit. the arm holes are a little large and hang low but can easily be remedied by wearing a camisole underneath. nice with leggings or skinny jeans.
4,"These pants are so soft and so comfortable! i was absolutely in love at first sight. however, i got the petite, because i am 5'3, and they were still a little longer than i like my pants to be. i wanted them to hit right above the ankle, just like the photo, however, they are a tad longer. i still love them and they are still as comfy as ever, so i am gonna deal with the length!!"
4,"Cute spring dress. fit can be a little challenging if you have a full bust. however, print is so beautiful. the material is soft. i liked the puff in the sleeve. it made the look more unique."
5,Better than the picture - i like the layered look and the texture of the fabric. great top.
5,"I love this top, it gives a little bit of a sleeveless look yet is more flattering on the arms for those who don't normally wear sleeveless tops. i think it runs very large - i'm normally a size s/m and the extra small was right. it's loose around the waist yet has a feminine fit.the tiny balls around the neck, button at the back, flutter sleeves, and linen fabric are all cute details that make this top unique. i also like how the fluttering goes down the sides and not just around the sleeve."
5,"The design is so cute (people in different yoga poses, small and subtle prints) and a must for a yogini. i love the colors, it's colorful but not too bright and it's beautiful against the white background. i ordered xs (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it fit perfectly (it has a fitted look but not tight because it has some stretch from the soft cotton material). i like the fact that there's no stretchy spandex feel, just pure soft cotton feel. it's great for gals who are conscious about the arms"
4,"These tights are so cute, but the sizing leaves much to be desired. i guess they are true to size since they are labeled s/m.

i'm 5'0"" with shorter legs than torso, and i suppose i'm lucky that i have muscular (read: large) quads/thighs to suck up some of the fabric, otherwise these might have just bunched up at my ankles.

the other thing i don't love about them is the feel of the fabric - it's more sweater-like (and not a soft sweater) than stretchy. maybe that was the intent, but i find tigh"
3,I love the style of this swimsuit on the model. when i purchased is i didn't realize that there was no support (wire/ padding/ lining) in the chest. the rest of the swimsuit was great but i did not like the look in the chest - it provided no support. i ended up returning it.
5,"I love this blazer. its perfect for work, and makes a great statement."
3,"I ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing, the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash, too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also."
4,"I vacillate betwixt saying this shirt runs large and small. i usually wear a small in retailer items, but the xs was all that was left in the charming bee print. the fit is flattering even though it's smaller than my usual size. conclusion: runs large. however, when i went to put my head through the top of the shirt, it was like being birthed. conclusion: runs small. bottom line: i'm in love with this shirt and so i'll just have to get used to the faux birthing feeling every time i put it o"
4,"I tried this in the store after looking at it online. the material was soft and flexible which was nice - i had been concerned that it might be stiff. however, it was a bit difficult to get on and off with the zipper on the back and the high neckline. overall, as a petite person, i felt the spots were too overwhelming for me. but if you like the spots, and have no trouble with back zippers, go for it."
4,"I had my eye on this coat for so long. when i saw it was on sale and an extra 30% off i decided to go for it. i ignored the reviews that said it ran big and took a chance and sadly it did not pay off. this jacket is very heavy so if you are going to get it on sale, it will probably go into the closet for next winter. it was very boxy on me and tied at the waist, made my upper half look huge. it was just not flattering at all. the heaviness of it also made the big open neck a little annoying and"
5,"The stitched v-neck tunic is a very charming piece to your wardrobe. it is soft and feminine, and has added charm with the fringed bottom.
it is a comfortable piece that looks great with leggings or skinny/straight jeans. 
it is a loose fitting design, so it is a bit large. opt for a smaller size if you prefer a closer fit to your curves."
3,"May look better on someone tall. thin, and straight."
4,"Not a summer dress even though the photos make it seem like it's for hot weather. the weight and layers and synthetic fabric is very substantial. it is a bit scratchy where there is maroon fabric, but not intolerable. i love this dress but it's beyond a-line, it's a tent. i'm keeping and will wear for fall with a long sweater to flatten the fullness that's seen in profile. for my body type (top heavy, thick shoulders/back/upper arms), i chose the smaller of my size range. definitely size down if"
5,"I am 5'5 about 110 lbs and the size 0 regular fits me well. sometimes i order petite, but the regular fit me just right. they are higher waisted than most pants i wear, but they are completely adorable and comfortable to boot. love the pattern. the sturdy quality is tangible. definitely going to order more of these pants in different patterns as they become available."
3,I really wanted to love this sweater after reading the reviews but when i received it i was sadly disappointed. it is pretty boxy and not much shape. could be cute for casual outfits but i was looking for some dressier sweaters.
4,"This is an awesome piece and i got many complements while wearing it! it is that rare combo of super comfortable yet amazing look all in one. it does run a bit big, especially on top but the stride is short so i had to keep my regular size or i would have had a wedgie all night."
4,"Since the reviews are quite polarized for this dress, i thought i'd throw in my $0.02...first, to clarify, there is indeed a zipper. it's well-hidden under the l arm (i didn't think there was one based on the reviews and got it on zipped fine; once it was on, i could feel the zipper [not uncomfortably, i just realized there was one]). dress does not have a lot of give, so i imagine that zipped, it would be difficult to get off. because no give, don't order down; that said, i found this dress to"
3,"I really wanted this skirt to work but it didn't look very flattering on me. a great midi length and very cool pattern, so hopefully will work for others!"
5,I really liked this cardigan. it is well made and very pretty. i will wear it when it gets a little cooler in early fall because i tried to wear it on one of these really hot days and it felt little too warm.
4,I am 5.1 and 113lbs. i ordered the petite size 26 and it fits like a glove. i gave 4 starts as i wish i had less stretch in it but other than that they are perfect length and sooo soft. super happy with the cut and waist height!
1,Wanted to love this colorful romper. the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking. no way would i wear this.
5,This dress will be perfect for the mid-september wedding i'm attending. september is a transitional month fashion-wise and this knit dress will be perfect. the shimmer (which isn't apparent from the website) makes it festive enough for a wedding.
5,"I bought these on sale and love, love them! they are comfortable and super cute with the print detail on the calves and around the waist. i am waiting to receive the matching hoodie. don't know it i will wear them together since i don't like to be too ""matchy"". i have worn the leggings with a long black tunic top and grey slip on sneakers. very happy with this purchase!"
5,"I fell in love with this top (sweater) before it could even be ordered - was on model for pants that were available to order. in any case, i later ordered the blue motif online and the colors are even more beautiful in person. the blue also contains fibers of wine - so very pretty. the gray is a soft shade. the quality is lovely too. the only cons are that the seater is rather heavy, but should be great for colder winter months and the zipper on the back is quite conspicuous. however, that said,"
5,"I love this shirt, it's easy to belt. i just wish it was tighter."
5,"I tried these on at the store and thought the color, texture and style was very nice, but i needed the petite length. so i came online but was disappointed to see that the style is sold out in petite! darn. the regular length hits me just above the ankle, so i suppose it is still do-able, but i hate to pay full price for something that doesn't fit quite right. maybe if it goes on sale i will consider it."
5,"This is absolutely beautiful.  but i am only 5'6""and the dress hits my thigh about the same place as it does on the model. one lean over to pick up my purse off the floor and i will flash everyone.   so i am going to wear it with dark denim leggings and tall boots.   likewise i did not detect even a speck of black. to me it is navy and purple. i was wishing it had black because those are my favorite leggings but quite honestly i think you're going to have to do navy or denim."
5,"Beautiful piece that i loved from the day i received it in the mail. lots of compliments, just a fun, pretty outfit."
5,"I am 5'2"", 110 lbs and i ordered my usual size xs and they fit perfectly. they are so soft and comfortable and keep me very warm. i can't wait to take them with me when we go to the snow next month!"
2,"Beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me. where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust, truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am. same with the arms, if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams. i'm 5'6"" and a classic size 8 and this"
5,Love love love this jacket!! great spring and fall weather.. very stylish!!
5,"First off, i love the dress! i love anything that you can throw on for a monday and be ready in 20 minutes. the material is good but the compartments for the bust do not hold a d+cup. i ordered the 6 and it fit perfectly except in the bust. easy fix, a white cami, the sale price makes that necessity acceptable. it's a keeper."
5,"I tried on this sweater in the store and immediately ordered my size. i got the petite small in natural delivered to my door several days later and am extremely pleased. the fit is roomy enough to layer, but not too large or boxy. the wool is fluffy and luxurious and has terrific appeal. i get compliments every time i wear it...""classic,"" ""fancy,"" ""jackie o."" are all terms i heard used to describe my favorite new sweater. the coat is made from a medium weight wool and is probably not meant for e"
5,"Similar to the previous reviewer, i'm also between sizes and for pencil skirts it's usually the larger size that end up fitting. whether this skirt runs large or maybe because it has a slight stretch, my smaller size (10) fits perfectly and seems comfortable enough to wear on a long flight or road trip. the fabric is wonderful, the skirt length is great for work, and the styling is really nice with added detail of buttoned loops at the waist. if i had one negative comment it would be an itty bit"
5,"I loved this jacket when i tried it on in the store, and brought home a size med. it's a nice weight of material, lined, and very classy. i liked the idea of adding it to my collection of suit-jackets for business meetings. but when i tried it on again using actual outfits from my closet, i realized how much it looked like a lab-coat. i am not giving up-- if it goes on sale, i'll order a small, to see if it is more flattering. but at this point, it's a no-go."
5,"These jeans were not for me. they are very straight...hence the name 'parallel'. i'm have more of a straight athletic build so for me it was too much straight and didn't flatter my shape at all.

however, very nice jean once again from pilcro."
5,This ruffle tee is adorable on. the fabric is light but not thin and the styling is very flattering to any figure. i look forward to wearing it as a transition piece as it stays warm long into fall in the south.
3,"This is absolutely huge.  it felt like it was at least 2 sizes too big - the empire waist wasn't even semi- fit.  36d chest and size small was like a tent.  however, the embroidery was beautiful"

5,"The shape is flattering on my postpartum body. even though the material is stretchy cotton and the shirt fits well across my shoulders and chest, the swing shape hides my stomach area. the material doesn't seem particularly breathable, so you might want to avoid wearing it in really hot, humid weather; but for my summers in the pacific northwest, it'll be fine."
5,"I never write reviews but this dress is so fantastic i felt compelled to write one. it has unbelievably gorgeous detailing, from delicate beading and sequins on the bodice to the three layers of the skirt: slip, floral pattern, pleats. i literally feel like a princess/ greek muse in this dress. can't recommend it enough. true to size; i'm 5'7"" and 133 lb and got a size 4."
2,"So i have had to return this once so far because the stitching ripped out when i sat down. the little slip thing that goes underneath if cheaply made. i really wish this were just lined dress. i wear it with a blank tank top and leggings underneath. not worth the money, but i needed something to wear that was transitional."
1,I received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all! it is a great fabric just way too much of it. it is proportionally incorrect width wise. unfortunately this one will be going back.
5,"I love this top! looks great with just about any kind of jean (skinny, flare, especially high waisted). even looks good with vests and cardigans. a perfect versatile piece for the fall - you won't regret!"
4,"I love this skirt; but it is so long that i have ordered the petite as well to see which one i will keep. i am tall; but even pulled up higher than my waist, there is at least 3 inches too much in length and i want to wear a flat shoe or boot with it. if i keep this one, it will need to be altered. 
it has pockets which i love. it is an effortless long skirt which i will wear christmas day for sure. the pattern is stunning with the mixed prints. the fabric is silky. it can be dressed down with a"
4,"I ordered this dress and wow , this is one really pretty dress, my only drawback is that the dress is not fully lined. for this price i was expecting a full lined dress. the flower detail and beading is amazing, but this one is going back hopefully it will be on sale soon, i might reconsider"
4,"I was on the fence about ordering my normal med, but so glad i did. it fits sooo well. i do think its more suited for warmer days since the material is very thin. its sort of a cropped length and looks great with sandals and heels. i don't like showing off bra detail and will add some kind of closure detail to hide bra or wear a very lightweight top underneath. this was a great buy especially with the sale."
5,"This blouse is just so beautiful! but i do love white blouses, so that may influence my enthusiasm. however, once i buttoned it up, it was just dreamy. i have a long torso and am tall for a typical xs, so it's often hard to find something that's the right length. this is perfect! it may overwhelm some ladies who are on the petite side of height, but it's a rare find for me. paired with a pair of cropped pants because i'd come in a dress, it looks delightfully vintage in the best of ways. i'm sti"

5,"Very soft, cozy, and exactly what is needed on tbose in-between days. the collar is a bit dramatic if you are petite, but there is an extra button that makes it more manageable. stylish, cute"
5,"Totally my style, i love how it hangs and is so soft and comfy. material is thin enough to be fairly lightweight, and i was worried about it being clingy -- so happy it's not! body skimming and very flattering for full bust (v-neck helps here) if like me you don't like tight chested clothing. also love the length of this top. i'm 5'4"" and 36ddd, size l fits me just how i like it."
5,This is a comfortable pretty blouse. i purchased the neutral print and am very pleased with it.
5,"Beautiful, timeless dress. runs small, straight fit. can't wait to wear it to work or a function,"
4,"I have been looking for a cold shoulder dress for a while, but haven't been able to find anything i really liked. i ordered this and picked it up at the local store. it is very comfortable and seemed a little big at first, so i washed and dried it and it seemed to shrink just a little to fit well. i love the open shoulders. i wore it with gray tights and gray boots for valentine's day and it was perfect for the cold winter weather. i think it is a bit overpriced, but i still love it! it's a nice"
5,"I bought this dress for my engagement photo shoot and rehearsal dinner and it's beautiful! it's delicate and feminine, without being too girly or frilly. very simplistic. and probably the comfiest piece of clothing i own! my only con is that i'm a little tall and it doesn't hit me completely on the waist, but it's still very flattering."
5,"I love this soft, glistening, flowy beauty!  it's my favorite color too!  i'm 5'5"", 34d, size 6 and a small fit me with room to spare.  don't wait!"
5,"Yes it is boxy, but by design. because it is a shorter length and sheer it isn't an issue for me even as a petite. it has a bit of an ethereal look on as if it's just floating on your body. what doesn't show well in online pictures are beautiful chartreuse, charcoal & white threads running throughout the design. this adds to the classy look of this top.
great to dress up jeans or with a dressy pencil skirt for a night out."
5,This is such a unique piece and could be dressed up or down. i can see myself wearing this with skinny jeans and a tee and adding a statement necklace or wearing over a dress. i tend to get hot so i like how light weight this is even though it is lined. it is of excellent quality but may run slightly small (or at least smaller than other items i have purchased through retailer). the drape is extremely flattering and i think that would be true for every figure. my favorite feature is the oversized
4,Great boho chic top. a bit over - sized but soft and love the colors!
5,I feel really cool wearing this skirt :-) a nice alternative to the jeans that are my standard uniform. loooks great with short boots. i'm wearing it as i write this review--and was wearing it all day. awesome skirt!
2,"When i saw this online i immediately put it on my ""must buy"" list. i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store, in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon. luckily, my b&m store had it and i am so glad i didn't waste my money or time ordering it online. this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark. what the product shot online doesn't show is that it has dol"
4,"I understand this is a pencil skirt, so it's gonna be more body hugging. however, this really did seem to run small. i only tried it on because it was on sale and there was a promotion. my thoughts below:
___________
pros:
- great design that will match with a lot of things.
- very soft and comfortable overall due to being part modal. lots of stretch.
- no dry cleaning here. hand wash, which is a plus for me.
- it's a thicker knit, but it's breathable, too. no issues with being see-through.
- re"
5,I found this tee to run true to size with a comfortable relaxed fit. the neckline and elegant button gives this tee enough detail to dress it up if you wanted to take it in that direction.
1,"This top doesn't at all fit like it does on the model. the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt-like. i typically wear size small or 4, but perhaps an xs might've fit or looked better. sadly i must return this shirt."
4,I bought the fuschia colored tank to wear under a sweater for the fall. great color. fits well.
5,So comfortable and warm! so nice to lounge in a cold day and be cute!
5,"Love this jacket! this picture shows the sleeves rolled down, but in the stores they have them rolled up and i have to say that is how you'll most likely wear it as the sleeves might be too short if you rolled them down. however, it is still a fabulous fall coat! it does run slightly large, but it depends on how you want it to fit. i am typically a medium, and i bought the m/l because the xs/s was a little fought in the shoulders. i bought last weekend and already wore twice because it looks gre"
3,"I was so excited to order this beautiful coat.  it does seem well made and is very soft.  unfortunately, the fit is completely off and is overall large.  i ordered a small, as this coat appears slightly more snug on top, a-line on the bottom, with three buttons.  i am 5'6"" and weigh approximately 145.  i was expecting this coat to be body-skimming.  instead it was overall large and the bottom of the coat awkwardly flared.  the  pleat on the back is unflattering.  sadly going back."
1,"Looked good in pictures. i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge! although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful, it is very awkward and poor fit. will be sending back."
5,"I purchased this dress for my 50th birthday bash!!! it was stunning!!! the fit was perfect. i did buy it a size up, but could have worn my regular size. it is incredibly flattering and elegant. very well made. one of my go to black dresses for the summer!!!"
5,"I love this sweater! it is very lightweight- the knit is a wider weave, so if you are cold natured be sure to layer and bring a jacket. the fit is great, it is very flattering on. the back is lined and has the gray fabric that shows past the sweater hemline which adds to the uniqueness. this could be dressed up or down- i paired with a white tee and dark jeans and flats but will wear it next with nice pants and maybe a white collared blouse. very happy with my purchase!"
4,
4,"Cute, swing top that would be flattering on most. i love the print on the white color and it's so soft. doesn't wrinkle easy. but it does run big! i'm usually a s in retailer but i was drowning in it. so, size down!"
4,This cardigan was a keeper for me. i love the pin that pulls the two sides together or worn open is just a nice decoration. four starts only because i felt like the arms ran a little short.
4,Beautiful shirt but runs huge! usually between a large or xl and i sized down to a medium.   the fabric has a nice sheen and it's a flowy shirt but seriously size down.
2,"I'm petite, but even if i weren't, i think this runs very large, isn't form flattering at all, and overall looks dull. it most definitely does not justify the price. material is thin."
5,"Just picked this up in my retailer store and i love it. i bought the orange print and the colors are vibrant and perfect for summer. i am 5'5"" and  140 lbs. i took a small which is my usual size at retailer. could be worn unbuttoned as a sleeveless cardi over a tank. i will wear a cami underneath as it is sheer, but that doesn't bother me. another shopper was trying this on in the fitting room and it looked great on both of us. i will wear this all summer long. looks great with denim. happy find!"
5,"I love this top!! it is flattering in all the right places. i struggle with shirts the are too flowy however this is forgiving yet looks more fitted and flattering. i bought the shirt in blue and am buying it now in red! i typically buy a large or xl, in this shirt a large is perfect!"
5,"I love these pants! they are slimming, can be easily dressed up or down, and they are super soft and comfortable."
4,"Super cute. cotton is substantial enough not to show bra lines, but light enough to be summery & breezy. i misread ""xs"" and tried it on, thinking it was a medium, & oddly there's barely any difference among the xs, s, and m sizes--the buttons didn't even buckle out across my bust on the smaller sizes--so, this top could be a nice ego boost if you want to size down (i got the m anyway). armholes not too big, ruffle hides any tummy flaws. great with jeans, shorts, and skirts--like a perfect white"
5,"I love this shirt for its subdued colors and casual style. it is lighter in weight than a flannel shirt but retains a feeling of softness. it is from cloth and stone, a brand i like. usually i buy that brand in a small because their shirts run large for me. i liked this shirt so much i ordered it twice and waited for a backorder. i sent the small size back and was lucky enough to get a medium before the next out of stock situation."
5,I bought this when it first came back a number of years ago and loved it because it is great for travel! it actually can be kind of a blanket when you are on airplanes that tend to be cold and it is so hard now to get a blanket. it is also great coat for me as i live in southern california and it is not too heavy but does help the evening chill. i went on a trip with this a few months after i originally bought it and i accidentally lef at the hotel i was staying at. i am so glad it is back so th
5,"I initially bought the red and blue sweater in a medium. i usually wear a large and the medium fits perfectly and is still a bit baggy. i'm tall (5'9"") and so i love the length of the sleeves when they are unrolled. it's a very versatile piece. with sleeves rolled down you can fold the collar so the red is out of sight and just have a navy blue sweater. either look is nice. i loved it so much i bought the black and brown version. also, the fabric doesn't feel thick but it is very insulating and"
5,I love this tank. i didn't find it to be see through at all. it runs true to size. it's super comfy and the lace up detail makes it more fun than a plain old tank top. it's a great basic and i love the lilac color.
4,This dress has a great design for any frame. it looks great with a belt to accentuate the waist but the dress stands great alone and doesn't require a lot of styling.
3,"I love vintage lace so i was very excited to try on this dress. unfortunately, it just didn't work for me. i'm a larger, busty lady (size 14) and i tried on the xl. it fit fine, but did absolutely nothing for my figure. it just kind of hung on me. even with the belt tie i still feel like it didn't accentuate my waist line. i think this is better for someone with a straighter figure."
3,"I ordered this attractive top in my usual size and tried it on with great anticipation. it fit perfectly except across the shoulders, a problem i haven't encountered before. i've tried it on twice more (do i hope my shoulders will shrink?), only to see that it pulls across the top of the back as before. otherwise, it is so pretty and flattering that i'll be truly sad to send it back."
1,"I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail, i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online, the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat, i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!"
4,"The moss color intrigued me so i ordered a medium instead of large because it looked oversized. i generally wear a large. medium is a good fit. probably could have ordered the small, but wanted to preserve the draping on the side. this top is very wide but it looks great on. so do size down. love the color variations. it's true to the pics and is a nice addition to my casual lifestyle."
5,"I love this sweater! i ordered the dark gray and wasn't expecting fabulous but that's what i got. the skirt below the waist tie is actually pleated so that it falls perfectly. the seaming detail is beautiful. i am between a size large and extra large and the extra large fit perfectly. the sweater is short, half way down my hips but looks good over a long tank. this a medium weight knit and will be wearable all year with skirts, dresses and any kind of trousers. this is one of my favorite purchas"
5,Very intricate detail with stitching. love the contrast of black on cream. has slits on each side. bought it for holiday parties! just what i had hoped it would be.
4,"This is a really pretty top. the yellow underneath is a very pretty shade and the tank itself is very soft and comfortable and just loose enough to hide any bit of tummy. the armholes are large, however, so they are low and make the front look almost like a halter with the way they come in. i would order down a size as a result. you'll be able to wear most bras with it but be aware that anything that spills out under your arms will be visible."
5,"I love this dress. it is exactly my style, which is probably why i love it: girly, frilly, flowy... i love how much material it has. it flows and twirls in such a nice way because of the amount of fabric. it's the right length that the amount of material is not overwhelming - i'm 5'5"" and it hits just above my knees. i am currently 6 months pregnant, and it's plenty roomy to fit now, and will also mask the post-baby belly this summer. the only 2 cons, and the other reviewers touched on these as"
3,"Didn't love it, didn't hate, rather indifferent. the grey was a little more muted than i wanted for a summer tee.
i'm 5'4"", 123lbs, 34a, the xs fit if it wouldn't shrink, if you're about this size but larger busted go with the s."
3,"I took a risk on this dress despite the multiple reviews about the pouffy skirt and revealing neckline, because i loved the look of the blue motif print. alas, the adorable print, the handy bra-strap holders, and super-soft fabric were the only things that worked for me. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lb, small up top, not especially curvy but not straight either, and i ordered my usual 2p. yup, the pleated skirt was much too full (i felt as though i was wearing a cheerleader's skirt) and the neckline was way"
2,"The other reviews seemed promising and so i ordered these in a 10 petite. i am 5'4"" and the length was still long and would either need to be worn with a heel or altered. the length was not what made me send them back though. the quality is very very nice and the fabric thick, stretchy and well made. however, the body hugging fit and flare make these look exactly like a yoga pant but made from nice material. if i were a bit more confident to wear these outside of the gym then they would be great"
4,"These are perfect with a long tunic for the weekend to run errands! they are not tights-like in the sense that there's full coverage across your bum -- no accidental flashing of anyone. they're not itchy either. i bought these in brown, and want to buy the rest of the colors available!"
5,"This dress looks better in person. the shape is pretty much straight, but fits nicely even if you are curvier. it doesn't show your imperfections. the type blue and white color is nice, but a bit see through on the bottom and the slip is a little short. came to about mid thigh for me so i would wear leggings underneath. i don't think a belt would look good with this because of the shape and if you have curves. very cool summer style."
5,"Better than the picture, right chest neck line not too low. comfortable material and the cut is just right. bought two in different color."
3,"I didn't have as much of a problem with the sheer fabric as the other reviewers, but this dress is incredibly long and large, especially compared to the picture. for reference, i'm usually a 4/6 in retailer dresses and the small was huge on me, particularly on the bottom half. i was very disappointed because this dress looks so cute online!"
5,"Fit is true to size, color is accurate. love the feel of the knit, it's weightier than if anticipated. i'm looking forward to wearing this to my pnw trips."
5,"Truly the only word that comes to mind when i think of this dress is dazzling! the pictures online just barely do it justice...if you have an retailer nearby, check to see if its available in store and go check it out in person. it does not disappoint! every year around this time, our beloved retailer seems to come out with this style of dress. in the years past they have all been different and beautiful, but i think they have truly outdone themselves this year. this dress is a deep emerald green..."
5,"I usually wear a 4, but ordered a 2 & 0 because of the previous reviews. the 2 fit perfectly. the 0 was too snug across the shoulders. both sizes were the same length and width except the shoulders.the material is beautiful and seems very well made. i am thrilled with this purchase.it looks exactly like the photo."
3,"I ordered the red version--it is incredibly cute, soft, vibrant, and a flattering a-line. however, this dress is sized oddly, running at least one or two sizes too small, particularly at the waistband. i ordered my usual size and one size up, and even the larger size was too snug in the waist.  yet at the same time, i had some gaping at the straps, and i have a full bust. even worse is the *impossible* side-zipper that is a workout to get past the seam at the waistband. trying to wrestle the zip"
3,"I really wanted to love this t and was excited to receive it in the mail. i thought i was being realistic in assuming that is would be somewhat sheer given that there doesn't seem to be a woman's white t on the planet that isn't these days, however it was really sheer. the fit was also short and boxy (this coming from a 5'3 woman who is short-waisted) on the plus size the material is extremely soft and the design is cute. maybe if you are younger and don't mind the sheerness it's worth the gambl"
5,"Great fit. smooth, comfortable material. wrinkles, but nothing an iron can't fix. beautiful colors, i got both the teal and the black."
4,
5,"I looked at this on the hanger and almost passed it up. i'm so glad i didn't because it ended up looking so much better on. i wear a s or xs in retailer tops and went with the xs. i'm 5'6"" and it still had plenty of room and enough length to cover my backside. i usually gravitate to reds but the red in this top, while pretty, had too much pink in it for me."
1,I ordered a med petite. usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down. as a regular shirt it was not cute.
5,"I am 5'4, so i feel i'm on the cusp of petite/regular sizing. i ordered 2p, (about 125-130lbs), and the dress fit perfectly. it's so pretty (i got blue), i ordered this for my upcoming trip for our anniversary...i feel like i can wear with sandals or heels, with leggings or no leggings. beautifully made. kind of pricey, but worth it."
4,"I spend a lot of time on the retailer website. it never occurred to me to try this dress. a salesperson suggested it in the store and i tried it on. it is really cute on. i bought a thrift store denim jacket to throw over it. the only con is the sleeves. i am 5'3' and my arms are not very long. the bell sleeves are a little crazy on me, but they will be hidden under the jacket."
4,"I tried on a small, but usually am xs:

this shirt dind't seem like it had too much fabric or too bulky to me as it did to others adn i tried on a larger size. teh material is soft and feminine, and love the embroidered detail. one thing to note is i found that even with the layer of fabric, it was still a bit sheer and i could see through in some of the dressing room lighting. didn't purchase only based on the skin tone v's shirt color. color of shirt is gorgeous, but i am pale and it wasn't"
5,"This has become a go-to work staple in my closet. soft, with a relaxed fit, makes this a very easy piece to work the day away in while still pulling off a dressy casual appropriate for my office. highly recommend"
5,"Love these jeans! they fit great, they feel great. i am 5'9.5 135 pounds. they fit everywhere you would like them to. unroll them and they are long! love love love!! so wonderful i just bought my second pair."
4,"This top is so much prettier on. you can dress it up or down. it does run a tad large. i'm 5'7"" and 145 lbs. i am usually in between a small and medium but usually a medium. i went for the small on this and i loved the fit of it. still pretty flowy and the medium would have been just too big. it is a tunic so it runs kind of long. a tiny bit too long for me but i will still wear it a lot."
3,"This dress is very cute and fits quite well. you don't have to wear a bra with it, which is awesome, and it has delightful pockets. the downside is that the fabric on the top half is a little weird. it is very heavy and stiff. also, the inside has some fraying and the quality does not seem to be the best. i'm keeping it though."
5,"These fit beautifully and are very flattering. they are true to size but may be a little long. i am 5'5"" and wear these with 2 in. heels. i have already had numerous compliments on them."
4,I love the idea of this top. it's made really well. the only issue is its a bit shorter than i thought and the neckline rubs on my neck.
4,"This top is really cute for the right body shape.
it is tight around the bust area if you select your size and sizing - you lose the shape."
5,"This is probably the softest, most flattering hoodie that i have ever worn. i can dress it up or down and it has drapes really beautifully. great for spring & summer, love it as a coverall at the beach. my partner rarely compliments my clothes and actually told me how much he liked the way it looked on me. highly recommend."
4,"It looks like the stores are finally receiving their supply of this really pretty dress. i've been watching its availability online and was getting frustrated. my local store had ample supply. it's a beautiful dress! as per an earlier review, it does run a little large. i love that it's made of cotton so it will be perfect in the summer and beyond. it's a full skirt but looks really pretty on. my local store showed it belted which looked good too."
5,"I read the online reviews that the dress ran large so ordered size 6 and 8. i'm normally an 8 or 10, and the 6 fit perfectly. dress hangs beautifully and lining is really soft. appears that it will wrinkle somewhat easily but i am keeping it anyway since it's so beautiful. the bell sleeves are really cute! i highly recommend the dress."
4,"I love these pants! typically, i have a difficult time finding pants that fit my smaller waist and curvier hips and legs, but these fit well enough. all i need to do it have the waist tailored and they will be perfect. the pants are also soft. the only downside, and it is not a deal breaker for me, is that they run a little large and seem to stretch out a bit with wear. considering this, i would downsize one size."
4,"This velvet t-shirt is perfect for the holidays! i usually wear a size 12 top, or a l, but i ordered up and got a size xl. it is very tight around my chest (36c) and armpits, and the v-neck sometimes spreads apart a lot if i move my arms around a lot. but other than that, it looks great, just runs small. if you are a size 14 or larger, i don't think that this will fit."
4,
5,This is such a pretty dress. light and flowy. i got it to wear on hot summer days.
5,This top is exactly what i was expecting. super comfortable while still looking stylish. just covers your bum so you can wear it with leggings or jeans!
3,Can't pants. the material is lightweight and perfect for summer. however i felt they were cut narrow in the hips. i am a solid size 30/8 and i couldn't get the 30 over my hips.
3,"Loved the color! loved the scallops! wish i loved it on me. the poplin fabric is very structured, which doesn't lend to a nice drape. the bottom hem was a little small for my curvy hips, so the top rode up a bit on me. looks lovely on a straighter figure, but wasn't amazing for me."
4,I liked these as soon as i saw them. the are very comfortable and the fit is great. well constructed and the material is soft but thicker.. easily worn into the cooler days. i am so happy i made this purchase!
2,"I was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable. however, while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist. i will acknowledge i'm a runner with somewhat muscular legs, but was hopeful these pants wouldn't cling to them. for reference, i'm 125 lbs and usually wear a size 25-26 in pants."
5,
5,I love this shirt. it is so soft. not boxy at all. very flattering. my only complaint is that there aren't more colors!
4,"Let me begin by saying i own quite few pilcro jeans, the script, and hyphen to name a few, absolutely love them, they fit tts, super soft with just the right amount of stretch. the em jean have the perfect retro look, super soft, with just enough relaxed fit to still look stylish. unfortunately, i noticed that they have gone up in price a bit since they were introduced as the signature jean for retailer, andddddd, they are no longer made in the usa, but in china....so you may need to try on"
5,I love these pants! they are very flattering. they do however run long so even though i'm 5'5'' the regulars were crazy long on me and the petite fit me perfectly. i was worried they would stretch out a lot but i've worn them twice and they haven't.
5,"This top is absolutely adorable, i cannot express how much i love it. paired with skinny jeans and a bright cardi for the spring, this can easily transition into summer. it's actually cuter irl than in the picture. if you are on the fence about this, get it! you won't regret it."
5,"This is a beautifully designed and made sweater dress. really love it. however, there's no way that model is 5' 10"" in the photo because i'm 4 inches shorter than that, and the dress is 2 inches shorter on me. it's really not a dress, it's a tunic. i'm happy with it because it's so pretty, but i did think i was buying a dress. i just wore it with leggings and i'm happy with a beautiful tunic!"
3,The fit is really flattering and cute but the fabric and finishings seem really cheap. it's a printed plaid - not woven.
1,Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown.  however this is a thin cashmere for the price.  returned.
5,"Love this top! i was worried it would plunge too deep, especially because i'm quite flat chested - but it is perfect. i think it would look gorgeous on a volumptuous woman too. that's the beauty of it. and the color is my absolute favorite right now ... :)"
4,"Easy breezy top that goes with so many outfits. i am petite (5'0'', 115lb), but like the longer look of a top, so went with 4r, thought that the arm holes would be too small if went with 2r. there is a lot of excess material around the sides...and back. i was tempted to return, but the armhole issue prevented me and it was so cute, i kept it. i think it will go through the a few seasons (seattle is unpredictable weather-wise...) and can be easily layered. i like the blouse...but don't love."
5,"The fabric is more sweater-like than it appears in the image, but it makes the dress both cozy and comfortable. the skirt is a faux wrap that's secured at the waist by the tie. overall, the dress is high-quality, true to fit, and very flattering."
5,"These jeans are pricey and worth every dollar.  fits in the right area and makes your butt look perfect.  ladies, if you have thick legs...these jean are meant for you."
5,"These feel so soft and amazing. i especially love that the length work for me, just a tiny bit long and i am 5'4. i did find that they ran smaller than my pilcro and other jeans."
5,"I'm 5 ft 3 inches, 130 lbs. this dress fits perfect! i bought a 4r. the petite 4 probably would have fit and been a inch or two shorter but i don't the regular looked bad. it hits an inch or two below my knee. medium thickness of fabric is forgiving even though the dress hugs in all the right places. beautiful dress!!"
5,"Really cute dress and i cannot wait to wear it for my wedding rehearsal dinner. the buttons on the back are my favorite part about the dress since they add something different. it fits tts, but it is more fitted than a regular shift dress, which is nice. i am 5'9, 145 pounds, and the size 6 fit me perfectly."
5,"Oh how i love this dress! i was pleasantly surprised at the texture of the fabric, it is a wonderful feel of cotton and not that poly that sticks to your fingers. it fits like a dream...true to size...romantic and flirty...i can see this with cowboy boots and hat as well as with evening sandals...the possibilities are limitless. i am so happy i was finally able to snag one up as a return because it sold out. just love it! i also plan to wear it in the fall with a jean jacket. it is a winter whit"
5,"Very comfortable nightgown, love that it had pockets. fit is as expected."
5,"Great pair of pants to wear to work, and interview or out to lunch. i got so many compliments the first time i wore these. i'm 5'2"" i ordered the burgundy color in a size 0, regular which is what i normally wear and they fit fine. however they were just a tad big in the waist and a tad tight around my calves but other that they're a great pattern pant to have you wont be disappointed!"
5,"Love this top. purchased in a size medium, my typical retailer size and is very comfortable and lovely. wearing it under the pink peplum cardigan it was shown together with as well as wear it with jeans and other pants. i wish it came in different colors and other images as this a very well made top. purchased during the after christmas tag sale and love it even more. will be great in spring and summer, cooler days in summer."
5,"Love this top! cloth & stone makes excellent quality clothes that are durable and have unique details. this top can go with many different looks and i can't wait to take it out for a spin!

i bought the medallion crops to go with this top and it is an awesome combo, i would definitely check it out!"
5,"This dress is even more beautiful in person. it fits true to size and drapes nicely from the body without being tent-like, as some swing dresses are prone to be. the material is very nice and the pattern is stunning and unique. as someone else mentioned, you can pair this with a cardi for work. it's also perfect for a night out. it's easily dressed up or down. and looks amazing with a skinny belt. i'm happy i bought this one!"
4,"I purchased these on sale. one thing to say, i had to return the first pai r (xs) as there was a missing section of stiching on the sema, creating a whole you can't really fix neatly. so i ordered a new pari. i usually like petite, but regular size was fine, they jsut end up being to the ankle (longer), not bunchy. i also ordered xxs peite to compare, but that was smaller on waist, almost not comfortable), and the laced-up part looked a little weird/overstretched. i have not used htem to work ou"
4,"I am usually an xsp or 0p but i ordered up one size (2p) due to previous reviews complaining about the tight slip. however i definitely did not need to size up. the slip is fine and the outer 'shell' is billowy and i should have stuck with my usual size! when i put it on i was not in love due to the dress being so roomy, but a second check in the mirror showed that the fabric / seams draped well and it overall looked pretty cute. it hits about 2 inches above my knees and therefore seems pretty p"
2,"Within 2 washings the color faded to a not so black black, like a pair of pants that has been washed over a year's use. after 5 or so washes the hook and eye closure began to fall off. the pants fit well, albeit a bit short (i'm 5'9"") and they run small. i sized up to a 6, when i usually am between a 2 or 4. i let the hem out, sewed the hook and eye closure back on and redyed them, and now they are good to go, but for nearly $90 i don't expect to have to do this much work. these are not my first"
5,"Short of calling it dark gray- which  isn't dark, but that's fine because i saw the picture. it's everything i wanted it to be. i just wish it was chiller here in georgia so i can wear it more often"
4,The design is very cute. i'm glad i listened to reviews b/c this blouse definitely runs at least 2 sizes small maybe 3. i bought the blue and it's more of a navy blue instead of royal blue. at the sale price and additional 40% off (my daughter is an employee) i didn't mind paying $24 :).
4,"This dress in orange is lovely. it's very light weight which i was slightly disappointed by, i prefer heavier dresses. but it'll be good for spring and summer. it still seems to be constructed well. i'm 5'8"" and 170 and the 8 i purchased is a little too tight. so i'm thinking it may run a little smaller than some other dress brands i have from retailer. 8 is usually my go to size. a 10 would have probably been perfect."
4,"I saw this dress and was immediately drawn to it. the pictures others posted of themselves wearing it just made me want it more. i knew the color said ivory when i ordered it, but i wasn't prepared for how yellow it was. there is a liner/slip and it was honestly a pale yellow. it made the whole thing look dingy. i was so disappointed. if this dress was white i would've kept it. sadly i had to return. i am 5'1, around 135 lbs and i ordered a petite 6. i probably could've gone a petite 4. very cut"
3,"The fabric of this dress feels like suede, i couldn't stop touching it. here comes the ""but"": the dress is cut straight down, no definition. the rosette lace is sewn on, like an afterthought just to make the dress not to look plain or cheap. i tried it on with a belt and by itself, and i still feel like it's just a plain dress that i can get at a discount store. i'm a big fan of tracey reese and own a lot of her dresses, and i feel that this is the most plain dress she ever designed. size s regu"
5,"I bought this at the store and when i picked it up i didn't think much of it until i tried it on! it is so adorable, i can't even tell you how much... i am 48 yo and normaly buy xs/s or 2/4 in retailer. mauve dresses are 2 most of the time. small chest, 5'5"" and about 130lbs and i got the size 4 and it is perfect! i hope it is age appropriate tho... ;) i have traveling plans this summer and i am thinking this could be an easy thing to take along with me, one piece clothing that will travel very we"
1,As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back.
4,I like that the top is lightweight and very comfortable and is flattering. i can see wearing this over the holidays for entertaining. it looks festive and pretty - something easy to pop on and look pulled together in a flash.
4,"I originally bought this for myself but it was way too big on my backside since i don't have much ""junk in the trunk."" i decided to pass it on to my sister since it was just too pretty to return. it fits her much better and she's worn it on a few occasions. it does run larger and the pants are very long. definitely have to be either hemmed or always worn with heels."
5,I love this top! the top has nice details and is not too sheer. it did have a smell at first but that's gone now.
5,"Incredibly flattering cut! i got so many compliments when i wore this dress to a friend's wedding. with the built in bra, you don't have to add extra uncomfortable layers. it stays put with or without the straps! the skirt is blissfully full and fun for twirling. i had a little trouble figuring out the belt, as it wraps around multiple times. but once i worked that out, it was perfect! love this cut! i hope they make it again it different colors!"
4,I really like the dress it is cute and comfortable. the only problem i'm having is finding leggings that match the way i want. dress will be cute with leggings and boots or sandals in the spring. it is very casual.
5,"I live in hawaii and always looking for a comfortable light and breezy dresses, this was perfect. the colors are gorgeous, the fit is true to size and it is extremely comfortable. dress it up or dress it down with a denim jacket and you will be definitely love it. i am thrilled i made the purchase!!"
5,"This is a beautiful blouse and well made!!! i read the previous reviews and i'm usually between sizes 8 and 10, so i sized-up, and ordered size 12 and it fits well. i purchased the pink, and it's soo pretty! i'm very satisfied with my purchase, and i highly recommend this blouse."
3,"This is a beautiful sweater and a nice medium weight. however, it is an awkward length. i am tall and have a long torso so it's just not cut right for me and was not flattering."
5,"I didn't give this dress a second look for the longest time. when the summer tag sale came about, i decided to pop in and see if i could find a versatile summer dress. i was in need of a piece i could easily dress up or down. the burnt orange color variation caught my eye first, though i also tried on the neutral and it is also fabulous. this dress is amazing on! i am an hourglass shape, 5'8, size 6/8, 34 d chest, and i tried on both the small and medium. the small fit much better on me, and i r"
4,"I do love this shirt as i am a yogi and love to wear things like this. it was a little boxy and big, but don't care because the style of it is so cute."
5,"This is a gorgeous dress. the print is beautiful and unique, however because it is baggy the dress does run big on smaller frames. i would definitely recommend sizing down."
5,Received this dress for christmas and fell in love. the detail and fit is perfection. the buttons go all the way to the bottom of the skirt so no concern for pesky flyaway exposure should the wind blow. the detail on the arms w the buttons is also cute and i personally loved the longer sleeve that almost comes to my elbow - it's very flattering. overall a great little dress!
5,"Love the fit and feel of the fabric. says to dry but i found the leg seams did bunch up a bit so next time i won't dry them, i'll hang to dry. very cute style. super comfy."
4,"These pants have a really cute design. however, they are a bit short (and i'm only 5'4""). i'm still happy i purchased them, but i thought i was purchasing full length pants (as shown on the model) and not capris."
4,"I was so pumped to see a slightly different version of last years, military swing shirtdress, because i loved the idea of it, but it was just was too voluminous and short for me... well, this year, i ordered a size up, remembering that last years dress ran right in the chest and shoulders. i guessed right! this time, in a size up, i had breathing room and was much more comfortable. this dress is also a lot less billowy. there is sting definitely a swing but a much less dramatic version! my issue"
5,This dress is beautiful. the neckline is not too low and the straps are wide enough so you can wear a normal bra! the waist is very flattering and the ruffle at the bottom is not too much. i am short so i ordered the petite and it is a perfect fit. now i just need some warmer weather!!
5,
5,This top was a great purchase even though it's a bit expensive. love the colors and the fit.
4,"Tried this in store today and id say it is exactly as pictured (length is similar on me at 5'7"", colors as shown, cut is loose but not overly sacklike). my normal size s fit loosely, but not in an unflattering way. sizing down might have been too narrow in the shoulders. the embroidery seemed to be good quality, but the fabric itself was on the thinner side with no lining. i would have liked to see a liner at this price (and probably would have bought), but i think i'll wait for a promo or sale"
4,I typically do well with jumpsuits but this one did not work. i am smaller on top than the bottom but not by much. i got the xs and it was tight in the calves and short in the waist but the top fit perfectly. maybe a s would have fit better but i got it on sale and s was out of stock. it defiantly did not look like it does on the model. :) i am typically a size 2. the material is really nice. i was hoping for a jumpsuit that could be casual an covered since most jumpsuits tend to show more skin
5,"I received so many compliments on these pants! these are not only classic, they fit amazing...look great with heels and/or booties. match both black and brown."
5,"The quality is there. these pants are just as pictured. very wide leg, romantic pants. the pockets lay nicely inside so as not to be bunchy like some pants do. these fit perfect and look great."
3,"Lovely palette and and fabric but the cut did not flatter my shape. the flowy cut broadened my silhouette and hit at my waist making me look bigger than i actually am. the overall effect was quite frumpy in spite of the flamboyant pattern. perhaps a better choice for someone built exactly like the model.
i will be returning it."
5,"This cute dress has a built in slip, so no need for a slip . i think it has a flattering fit and the colors are pretty!
i feel like i could wear this dress to a shower, out to dinner, or just for a fun look to shop on a nice day!"
5,"I love this dress! the design is simple, colors and patterns are eye-catching but not over the top. cutting is perfect for me and very flattering. the material is flowy not clingy. it is a piece of easy, no-hassle garment that i would love to wear everyday and make it my uniform. seriously, it doesn't get better than that. if they make more of this style with different colors and patterns, i will just buy them blindly.

a word of caution: the dress does have slightly bigger armholes so some pe"
5,"I absolutely love this sweater. it's soft, and delicate. i bought a green one which flatters my skin tone. i feel that i can wear it for three seasons, except summer... lol

it runs a bit large. i normally wear size medium for tops from retailer, but the size s of this sweater fits better than size m. the sleeves are bit long than other sweaters, but i think that's the style, as shown on the model.

if you like feminine and romantic tops/sweaters, you will like this piece. :)"
5,"I wish i could wear this sweater every day! it is extremely soft. runs large. 5'9"", 130lbs, bought a large and it was way too big, but i successfully shrunk it in the dryer. sleeves are too bulky. it's not perfection, especially the sleeves. the photo shows the models with the sleeves pushed up. there is no way you could do that. they are almost like bell sleeves, and the material stretches like crazy. wish i had ordered down, but still love it."
5,"This dress is versatile and cute! i purchased the xxs at 5'4"" 115lbs and it fit perfect. a steal at the sale price!"
5,The pullover is very light weight material so great for fall or spring. it hangs nicely in front and back and is slimming. i ordered a medium other than the sleeves are not as long on me as the model it fits perfectly.
3,"I love tunics and really wanted this to work. i got this in a size s and it is absolutely gigantic. everything else about it is great, and i still haven't decided if i will try to swap it for an xs, which is definitely not my usual size (which is usually m, but often s at retailer). the pink/red color was quite pretty. if you have broad hips, fear not - you can size down and this top will still be generous around your hips. basically, if you're deliberating between s and m for this top, get"
5,"These are perfect for pulling off a finished look, proper enough for teaching in yet fun enough for going out afterwards or just running errands. the polyester material is substantial, lined and easy care. the pockets lay flat but may not be very useful since the skort is pretty fitted. i plan on wearing these a lot this year!!"
5,"So comfy. i'm 5'8"" a-cup & it fits well. i bought a small. an acquaintance of mine has it & she's petite w boobs & it looks great on her too. she has black & i have lavender. great purchase!"
5,"The fabric pattern is darling. i wore it in amsterdam and was told it looks like a traditional folk pattern. the dress is lightweight and is loose at the waist. sometimes i add a belt to cinch it in.

like another reviewer said, the buttons do pop off easily. i lost one at the cuff on the first day i wore the dress."
4,Simple pull-on pant with a great design. they look flattering on and can easily be dressed up. i wear between a 4 and 6 and the small fit perfect. i have washed them and worn them several times and they still seem good as new. the wide elastic waistband ensures that they stay in place.
4,"The burgundy and black dress is stunning on. beautiful cut and colors. i think
i do need the petite however. the material is not as stretchy as other dresses, but the dress does keep its shape."
1,"Too much material everywhere. i am 122lbs 5'4"" and i ordered an xs as usual. i was overwhelmed in a blanket of knitted material of muted colors. nice green slip, though. i will return it asap. this is super-ugly."
5,"I find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small. i'm usually an 8 but needed this in a 10. this shirt is reallly just perfect. great sleeve length. just the right amount of v neck. beautiful pattern with a vintage feel. i love the combo of stripes, polka dots and sweet flowers."
3,"Online this dress looks so perfect, but in person it's a bit dowdy and unflattering, at least on me. i'm a size 4 with curves, and i was hoping it would enhance my waist and flatter my figure. but, sadly, it was too large on the waist and too poofy in the skirt, so it just did nothing for me. i considered sizing down to a 2 so that the waist would fit, but the skirt still has too much fabric, making my hips look large. so much potential, but missed the mark for me."
4,"This jumpsuit is cuter than it looks online. my store displayed it with a brown belt, which dresses it up. it is perfect for our hot summers with brown or silver sandals. i will wear it with a short sleeve white cotton tee. i'm 5' 7"" and bought the extra small. pricey but worth it, so stylish. so retailer!"
5,"At first, i thought that this sweater would be too thin and show any imperfections, but it doesn't. the vertical ribbing really gives it a slimming effect and it is a perfect lightweight cover up that goes with pretty much anything."
5,"This blouse drapes and floats lightly like a dream. the dark black patterned top is not see-through which means you can easily wear it without having to layer. the length covers past your hips and the pattern is flattering.

the doubled-up buttons makes the blouse unique and it's comfortable enough to wear to work or with jeans from late summer into fall."
1,"I really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it...but when i washed it, according to the directions on the tag, it shrunk! a lot! the sleeves are now too tight, and it is much shorter. thinking about returning it to the store, but in any case, i cannot wear it again."
4,"I saw this sweater coat in store and thought it was gorgeous! i was turned off by the price so i waited for it to go on sale. luckily, i snatched it up right away. as other reviewers have stated, it is meant to be worn as a coat/jaclket and for me the medium ( i am usually a size 8 or medium in retailer) fit was slighly oversized on my 5'9 145lb frame. i admit that this not an item that i would usually have in my wardrobe and was not sure how the sweater and the fit looked on me. i was afraid it w"
2,You can adjust this dress a bit with the straps but it's huge! the colors were also a bit grayish which i didn't expect.
5,I am loving this shirt. i thought it would look ridiculously long on me but it does not. for me this is a great substitute for the cloth & stone fringed plaid buttondown dress. it's definitely not a dress but is long enough to pull off the layered look of wearing a t-shirt and this on top. it will be a great piece for the fall given how incredibly soft and light weight it is. highly recommend.
5,"These are so comfortable, it's like wearing jammies outside. i love the pattern and you really can't be the comfort."
5,"As soon as i saw this dress online, i knew i wanted it!  i was immediately drawn to the belled sleeves and lace embellishment along the neck/shoulders.  i ordered online, and was so happy with the fit and quality of the dress.  i am 5'5 and it hits just an inch above my knee.  it's the perfect little black dress for a fun date night or an event!"
2,"On me, thsi was ginormous, looked like a mu mu. it is pretty, but there was just too much fabric, even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice, and it looks pretty, but overwhelming. i will say, i think it would work on tail lean people, i have pretty muscular shoulders, so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier, no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try, just not for me...

ref: 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist."
5,"Has to be one of my favorite retailer purchases! the shirt is so soft and can be paired with so many different items. the turtle neck will help keep you warm, although the actual material is a little thin. don't let that dissuade you though. you won't be disappointed by this purchase! i'm going to get the other color too :)"
3,Gorgeous color! salmon not pink though! lovely soft drape fabric but the itty bity thread and hook in the center is awful! i am a size 2/4 d cup and ordered a small and the closure is not adequate at all! it looks terrible closed and is too revealing without a cami underneath. does not fit like the model!
5,This is a darling dress at this price point. i tried some of the more expensive options in the off-the-shoulder dresses this season and this one is as flattering and as well constructed as the others. the fabric is light but it is not sheer. it is smooth with a bit of a sheen. it is airy but not drapey like a rayon would be. i would describe it as a lawn. upon arrival the packaging indicated that it is considered a 'cover-up'. the site did not describe it that way but it may explain the comparat
4,I loved this dress and i am usually a 2 or 4 in dresses. this was cut too small on the bust. i'm a 32c and it pulled at the chest. i didn't re-order it because i felt it would look more like a house dress and be too baggy in the hips.
5,Gorgeous soft colors that can be worn with many things. lightweight fabric with beautiful detailed finish to the neckline. i purchased at my local retailer store along with the baroque tee (that i purchased in a smaller size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts). highly recommend both!
3,"I put a lot of hopes on this pullover. i needed something for the spring, and it seemed perfect. plus, the sale price is very attractive compared to the regular retailer prices. but... i am not exactly disappointed, but i'd say surprised. 

i would still consider this sweater good for spring. it's thin enough to be tucked into a skirt or pants if you like. the pullover is very stretchy - frankly, i would prefer it to be less stretchy, but that might be a plus for someone more busty. the quality"
5,"Despite being a knit, this skirt holds its shape and is absolutely perfect. it goes with everything and is extremely comfortable."
5,"I am so crazy about this dress. i got it in the mail today and just love it!  no, it's not lined but it's not see through so no big deal. i was afraid the tie would add bulk but i look very thin. i just need to call for a price adjustment since i payed full price!"
1,Top is completely see through. i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like. it is a cute design but not practical at all.
5,"I love this top! it's very delicate and pretty. flattering cut. the fabric is sheer, so wear with a cami or a pretty bra."
5,"Absolutely love this top. it can be worn with jeans or a nice pair of pants. material is so soft.. love the length , little longer in the back. definitely would buy in another color"
3,"The dress is great for pear shapes. however, i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing. ordered a small (5'8"" 140#) and i still think it may be a bit big. the material is very comfortable, not too thick or thin. however, i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric. see the attached photo."
1,"I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it, not only was it too long, but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available, i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it's really bad quality."
