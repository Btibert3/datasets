"It has a13 bionic but surprisingly antutu score lower then ip 11.Overall good. But not the best,Camera is excellent.Display is good but missing amoled at this price point. The main problem is battery. I use only 1 day and mostly new phone gives u good battery but in iphone se u didn't expect much. Bcs it has only 1800 mah, i think should be 2400 mah,But performance is really good, i think most people are not able to use it's beast processor bcs small in size, and lower the capacity of ba...READ MORE",5

"Am not of a Iphone user being this my first Iphone, and earlier I have used Motorola one Power, Redmi 3S Prime and some of the battery efficient android phones, charge doesn‚Äôt t last much. Iphone has it‚Äôs name over battery inefficiency, so can be ignored. And since I had a screen size specific requirement, I have no regrets. Shifting from Android to IOS, is a bit messy. Overall performance of the phone is decent. I feel I paid hefty for the brand image of Apple.READ MORE",4
NICE PRODUCT... within the price 25000rsREAD MORE,5
Very happy with this phone. Was using the first generation SE and it is a good upgrade. Battery life lasts a day depending on usage. Very good quality and finish. At the price of 26.5k it was a steal. Unhappy with the exchange offer as it was suddenly reduced by more than 60% of initially offered value without any screen or body damages and phone in working condition.READ MORE,5

"Getting nostalgia of iPhone 7 days. This is a pocket size beast. Simply perfect for a single hand use and feels so premium with those aluminium sides and glass back in hand.

"From a first time iOS user I am using Pixel 4a and I got this phone for my wife. Very smooth experience, quite different then regular android and marginally better then Pixel's.Camera quality is quite good, even in comparison to Pixel, but I believe it's mostly because of its punchy colours.Layout/Usability/UI is quite different and it's taking some time to get used to it.Hardware is very premium, better then my existing pixel 4a.Functionality and Customization wise I find it lackin...READ MORE",5

"It is a good phone, phone camera is really awesome!! Performance is also great!! No doubt the A13 Bionic chip is simply flawless. One thing you need to keep in mind while buying this particular beast: battery backup is really low! For that you can keep a power bank! Except the battery backup, the phone is really unmatched and top in performance. Great pick instead of One plus Nord!! Picture quality is really great with so many options in it.

"If you don't know the benefits of the Apple ecosystem, this is the phone to introduce you to it and if you use it properly, you will never go backIt's (comparatively) reasonably priced. In fact given it's processor which is the same as one in iPhone Pro which costs more than a lakh plus Apples' updates thay go on for 5-6 years, it's probably better value than most ""cheaper"" phones out there.The camera is great and Touch ID in this age of mask wearing is perfect.

"The seller sells two variants of the same phone. One with charger brick, cable, and earphones. The second variant is sold just with a Type-C to lightning cable. And both are priced the SAME! Unfortunately, the first type was not delivered by Flipkart in my locality. And add to that, normal genuine Apple chargers have a USB Type A female port, which basically means the cable supplied with the second variant (Type-C) is useless. The phone is very good though.

Never buy anything from Flipkart. Apple product standard is as is. But Flipkart is simply ridiculous & 3rd class place to buy. It had shown that on exchange policy minimum it will pay back 1400 in return of iphone 6 even if glass has scratch or touchscreen is not working. But these bogus platform does not do what it shows. The delivery boy came & have not exchanged with the old phone saying glass has scratch & half of touchscreen is not working. Instead he forced to pay exchange value of Rs 3...READ MORE,1

"1. Amazing performance: the speed in opening and closing apps is amazing. iOS always had anyways a much sophisticated feel. The speed has increased it manifold2. Camera is good but not as much as you‚Äôd find in android phones of this budget. That can be foregone considering other advantages. Though I would say that there are some neat features like good quality HDR, slow-mo, Live Photo, ability to move from photo to video. The best feature here is the shutter speed which you will not get in a...READ MORE",5

"Excellent purchase I have grabbed after my dslr from Flipkart. I got it in just 28,000. But the only sad thing is my WhatsApp messages couldn't backed up as I was a android user. Rest difficulties with transfer of photo, musics and limitations with downloading from internet can be manageable somehow. Otherwise phone's processor, camera, design, sound quality, metal body, touch-ID is wonderful. If you are a small phone lover, Its a good offer for you with excellent features. Thank you.READ MORE",5

I strongly recommend this phone to people who is more work oriented. Game loves should skip this phone as this is not a game phone. Best features with stunning looks & performance. Mobile is very handy with 4.7 inch screen. Packed with good performances and nice camera. This is my first iPhone. Very good experience with Apple. Battery performance is good but not excellent.

"I used windows phone, android phone (Lenovo and Moto) and now this. I am not impressed more than my previous phone Moto X4 to this. Be it charging, ease of using.

Apple surely delivered a product whose price is finally at-par with other state-of-the-art smartphone brands. The processor and speed are amazing with zero lag. iOS experience is quite pleasing after switching from Android. The external sound is terrific and one of the best a smartphone has to offer. Touch and display are beyond expectations. Overall feel is quite good and the bezels don't really affect much. The only downside is the camera and battery. Both are modest at best.

"Before buying this phone, I was a little worried due to negative reviews about the battery. But once I started using the phone, all my worries were gone. I have a fast charger, so the phone gets charged up pretty quickly and as for battery,  it easily lasts somewhere between 24 to 36 hours. The camera, the A13 bionic chip, they're all great too.READ MORE",5

No SD card slot. It says it‚Äôs dual SIM but second SIM has to be an e-SIM, doesn‚Äôt solve the purpose. Not having any great features. All in all okay okay product.READ MORE",2
